A. Prompt - Whitepaper Strawman
Develop a Decentralized Autonomous Application (DAA) concept that utilizes AI and machine learning to create and manage its own infrastructure. The application should use a web assembly (WASM) container and a combination of cloud, blockchain, and other decentralized components to replicate itself, deploy code to various services, and scale efficiently. It should also have self-sustaining economics using cryptocurrencies and incentives to generate income, employ people using a DAO, and create sub-autonomous applications and organizations. 

The technical whitepaper should include the following:

I. Introduction

Overview of DAA concept
Brief history of DAA
Why DAA is the next stage in internet, AI, and applications
II. Related Works

III. Technical Examples

WASM container
Cloud and blockchain services
Self-creating code
Iterative approach to building and testing
Self-sustaining economics using cryptocurrencies
Proactive security optimization & auditing
IV. Positive Usage of DAA
