# Rust GPU Architecture Decisions

## Core Design Decisions

### 1. Multi-Layer GPU Abstraction
**Decision**: Implement a layered GPU abstraction with wgpu as the primary interface and native CUDA/ROCm for performance-critical paths.

**Rationale**:
- wgpu provides safety and portability across GPU vendors
- Native bindings enable maximum performance for hot paths
- Runtime feature detection allows optimal path selection

**Implementation**:
```rust
pub enum GpuBackend {
    Wgpu(wgpu::Device),
    Cuda(cudarc::CudaDevice),
    Rocm(hip::HipDevice),
    Vulkan(ash::Device),
}
```

### 2. Zero-Copy Expert Routing
**Decision**: Use CUDA Unified Memory for zero-copy access between CPU and GPU.

**Rationale**:
- Eliminates memory transfer overhead for routing decisions
- Enables dynamic expert selection without data movement
- Reduces memory pressure on GPU

**Key Innovation**: Direct GPU pointer arithmetic for expert weight access without copying.

### 3. Lock-Free Swarm Communication
**Decision**: Implement wait-free algorithms using atomic operations and ring buffers.

**Rationale**:
- Traditional locks cause GPU stalls
- Wait-free algorithms guarantee progress
- Ring buffers enable broadcast without contention

**Implementation**: Shared memory ring buffer with atomic read/write positions.

### 4. Fused MoE Kernels
**Decision**: Combine routing, expert computation, and aggregation into single kernel.

**Rationale**:
- Reduces kernel launch overhead
- Improves cache locality
- Enables tensor core utilization

**Performance Target**: >10 TFLOPS on A100 GPUs.

### 5. Memory-Mapped Expert Storage
**Decision**: Use memory-mapped files for expert weight storage with GPU staging buffers.

**Rationale**:
- Enables experts larger than GPU memory
- OS handles paging automatically
- Predictive prefetching hides latency

**Implementation**: LRU cache with async DMA transfers.

## Fly.io Specific Optimizations

### 1. GPU Selection Strategy
**Decision**: Default to A100-40GB for training, T4 for inference.

**Rationale**:
- A100 provides best performance/cost for training
- T4 sufficient for inference with lower cost
- L40S for memory-intensive workloads

### 2. Multi-Region Deployment
**Decision**: Distribute experts across regions for fault tolerance.

**Rationale**:
- Prevents single region failures
- Enables geographic load balancing
- Reduces latency for global users

### 3. Container Optimization
**Decision**: Multi-stage Docker builds with minimal runtime dependencies.

**Rationale**:
- Reduces container size and startup time
- Improves deployment speed
- Lowers storage costs

## Novel Architectural Patterns

### 1. Unified Memory Expert Router
First implementation of MoE routing using CUDA Unified Memory for zero-copy access.

### 2. GPU-Native Lock-Free Algorithms

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Memory Fragmentation
- Use memory pools with fixed-size allocations
- Implement periodic compaction
- Monitor fragmentation metrics

### 2. GPU Failures
- Checkpoint expert states regularly
- Implement fast recovery mechanisms
- Use redundant expert replicas

### 3. Network Bottlenecks
- Gradient compression algorithms
- Adaptive communication patterns
- Local gradient accumulation

| Memory Bandwidth | >80% peak | Maximizes GPU utilization |
| Kernel Efficiency | >90% | Minimizes wasted compute |
| Scaling Efficiency | >90% | Near-linear multi-GPU scaling |

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Dynamic Kernel Generation
Generate optimized kernels based on model configuration.

### 2. Heterogeneous Execution
