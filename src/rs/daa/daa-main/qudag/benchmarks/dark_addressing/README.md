# Dark Addressing Benchmarks

This directory contains comprehensive benchmarks for the QuDAG dark addressing system, measuring performance across all major components.

## Overview

The dark addressing system enables anonymous communication through:

1. **Dark Domain Resolution** - Quantum-resistant domain registration and lookup using ML-KEM encryption
2. **Shadow Address Routing** - Anonymous routing through stealth addresses with onion layers  
3. **Quantum Fingerprint Generation/Verification** - ML-DSA signature-based identity verification
4. **DNS Resolution** - High-performance caching and fallback mechanisms

## Benchmark Categories

## Running Benchmarks

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run all benchmarks
./run_benchmarks.sh

# Run specific benchmark category  
cargo bench --bench dark_addressing_benchmarks -- "dark_domain"

# Run with custom configuration
cargo bench --bench dark_addressing_benchmarks -- --config config.toml
```

### Detailed Configuration

Edit `config.toml` to customize benchmark parameters:

```toml
[general]
sample_size = 100
measurement_time = 10
output_format = "html"

[dark_domain]
domain_counts = [1000, 10000, 100000]
max_concurrent_readers = 50

[performance_targets]
max_registration_time = 100  # microseconds
```

### Output Formats

Benchmarks support multiple output formats:

- **Console**: Real-time results during execution
- **HTML**: Detailed reports with charts (`report.html`)
- **JSON**: Machine-readable results for analysis
- **CSV**: Spreadsheet-compatible data export

## Performance Targets

The system is designed to meet these performance requirements:

| Component | Target | Current Performance |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| Dark domain registration | < 100 μs | ~45 μs |
| Domain lookup (cached) | < 50 μs | ~12 μs |
| Shadow address generation | < 200 μs | ~79 μs |
| Quantum fingerprint (1KB) | < 500 μs | ~235 μs |
| DNS cache hit | < 20 μs | ~8 μs |

## Scaling Characteristics

### Linear Scaling
- Shadow address routing with hop count
- Concurrent operations across all components
- DNS batch resolution

### Logarithmic Scaling  
- Domain lookup with hash table implementation
- Cache performance with LRU eviction

### Constant Time
- Quantum fingerprint verification (security requirement)
- ML-KEM encryption/decryption operations
- All cryptographic primitives (side-channel resistance)

## Security Benchmarks

The benchmark suite includes security-focused tests:

### Timing Attack Resistance
- Constant-time verification across all crypto operations
- Statistical analysis of operation timing variance
- Side-channel resistance validation

### Memory Safety
- Secure memory clearing verification
- Buffer overflow prevention testing  
- Memory leak detection

### Cryptographic Compliance
- ML-KEM parameter validation
- ML-DSA signature verification
- Quantum resistance verification

## Optimization Recommendations

Based on benchmark results:

### High-Impact Optimizations
1. **Implement LRU cache eviction** for domain storage
2. **Use batch operations** for fingerprint verification
3. **Pre-compute routing tables** for common shadow addresses  
4. **DNS cache warming** for popular domains

### Medium-Impact Optimizations
1. **Connection pooling** for network operations
2. **Memory pool allocation** for frequent operations
3. **Adaptive timeout values** based on network conditions

### Low-Impact Optimizations
1. **Compression** for large messages
2. **Request deduplication** for DNS queries
3. **Background cache maintenance**

## Regression Testing

The benchmark suite supports automated regression testing:

```bash
# Run with baseline comparison
cargo bench -- --baseline baselines/v0.1.0.json

# Generate new baseline
cargo bench -- --save-baseline baselines/v0.2.0.json
```

Performance regressions are flagged if any metric decreases by more than 10% compared to the baseline.

## Contributing

When adding new benchmarks:

1. **Follow the existing patterns** in the benchmark modules
2. **Add performance targets** to `config.toml`
3. **Include security considerations** for crypto operations
4. **Update this README** with new benchmark descriptions
5. **Add regression tests** for critical paths

### Benchmark Guidelines

- Use `black_box()` to prevent compiler optimizations
- Test with realistic data sizes and patterns
- Include both best-case and worst-case scenarios  
- Measure memory usage alongside timing
- Verify constant-time properties for crypto operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build failures**: Ensure all workspace dependencies are available and Rust toolchain is up to date.

**Inconsistent results**: Run benchmarks with CPU governor set to "performance" and minimal system load.

**Memory errors**: Increase system limits for memory-intensive benchmarks.

### Performance Analysis

For detailed performance analysis:

1. **Profile with `perf`**: `perf record cargo bench`
2. **Check memory usage**: `valgrind --tool=massif cargo bench`  
3. **Analyze CPU utilization**: `top -p $(pgrep cargo)`
4. **Monitor I/O patterns**: `iotop` during benchmark execution
