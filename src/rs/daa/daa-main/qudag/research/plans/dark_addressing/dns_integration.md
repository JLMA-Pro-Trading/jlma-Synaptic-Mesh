# ruv.io DNS Integration Plan

## 1. Cloudflare DNS Configuration

### Primary DNS Setup
- Configure primary and secondary nameservers on Cloudflare
- Set up DNS records for ruv.io domain:
  - A/AAAA records for main infrastructure
  - NS records for delegated subdomains
  - TXT records for domain verification
  - CAA records for certificate issuance control

### DNS API Integration
- Implement Cloudflare API client for dynamic record management
- Support record creation, updates, and deletion
- Handle rate limiting and error scenarios
- Implement automatic DNS propagation verification

### High Availability Configuration
- Configure geographically distributed DNS servers
- Implement DNS-based load balancing
- Set up health checks and failover mechanisms
- Monitor DNS query performance and latency

## 2. DNSSEC Implementation

### Key Management
- Generate and manage DNSSEC key pairs:
  - Zone Signing Keys (ZSK) - 2048-bit RSA
  - Key Signing Keys (KSK) - 4096-bit RSA
- Implement secure key storage and rotation procedures
- Configure automated key rollover schedules

### DNSSEC Record Configuration
- Set up DS records at parent zone
- Configure DNSKEY records for public key distribution
- Implement RRSIG records for zone signing
- Set up NSEC3 records with opt-out for zone walking prevention

### Validation Process
