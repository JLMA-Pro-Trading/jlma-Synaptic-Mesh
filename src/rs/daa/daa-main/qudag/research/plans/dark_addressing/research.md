# Quantum-Resistant Domain Name Systems Research

## 1. Post-Quantum Cryptographic Domain Name Systems

### Core Components
- DNSSEC replacement using post-quantum signatures
- Quantum-resistant KSK (Key Signing Keys) and ZSK (Zone Signing Keys)
- Integration of ML-DSA (Modular Lattice Digital Signature Algorithm) for record signing
- Hash-based signature schemes (SPHINCS+) for long-term root trust

### Security Considerations
- Quantum computer threat model for DNS cache poisoning
- Side-channel resistance in name resolution
- Forward secrecy for DNS queries
- Zone enumeration prevention

## 2. Dark Routing Protocols

### Architecture
- Decentralized routing overlay networks
- Quantum-resistant peer discovery
- Multi-path name resolution
- Stealth broadcast mechanisms

### Technical Implementation
- ML-KEM for session key establishment
- Onion-style routing layers
- Timing attack mitigation
- Traffic analysis resistance

## 3. Stealth Addressing Techniques

### Methods
- One-time addresses for name resolution
- Hierarchical deterministic addressing
- Blinded resolution paths
- Ephemeral zone structures

### Privacy Features
- Query unlinkability
- Zone walking prevention
- Resolution path mixing
- Temporal address rotation

## 4. Integration with Existing DNS Infrastructure

### Compatibility Layer
- Bridge nodes for legacy DNS
- Transparent resolution proxying
- Quantum-safe certificate chains
- Hybrid cryptographic transitions

### Deployment Strategy
- Incremental rollout paths
- Backward compatibility mechanisms
- Migration tooling requirements
- Performance impact assessment

## Research Questions

1. How can we ensure quantum resistance while maintaining DNS performance?
2. What are the trade-offs between privacy and usability in dark routing?
3. How can we prevent quantum computers from breaking historical DNS data?
4. What is the optimal approach for transitioning existing infrastructure?

## Next Steps

1. Prototype post-quantum DNSSEC replacement
2. Benchmark ML-DSA/ML-KEM performance in DNS context
3. Develop proof-of-concept dark routing implementation
4. Create integration testing framework
5. Draft detailed technical specifications
