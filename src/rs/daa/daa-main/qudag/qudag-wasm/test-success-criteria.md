# Test Success Criteria and Coverage Targets

## Overview

This document defines the success criteria and coverage targets for the QuDAG WASM test suite. All criteria must be met before a release candidate can be approved.

## Coverage Targets

### Code Coverage Requirements

| Test Type | Line Coverage | Branch Coverage | Function Coverage | Statement Coverage |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Unit Tests | ≥ 95% | ≥ 85% | ≥ 95% | ≥ 95% |
| Integration Tests | ≥ 85% | ≥ 75% | ≥ 85% | ≥ 85% |
| E2E Tests | N/A (Critical Paths) | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Overall | ≥ 90% | ≥ 80% | ≥ 90% | ≥ 90% |

### Critical Path Coverage

All critical paths must have 100% test coverage:
- Cryptographic operations (key generation, encryption, signing)
- DAG vertex addition and validation
- Consensus voting and finality
- Data persistence and recovery
- Error handling for security-critical operations

## Performance Criteria

### Latency Requirements

|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Key Generation (ML-KEM-768) | < 50ms | < 100ms | < 200ms | < 500ms |
| Vertex Addition | < 5ms | < 10ms | < 20ms | < 50ms |
| Signature Verification | < 10ms | < 20ms | < 40ms | < 100ms |
| DAG Query (1K vertices) | < 1ms | < 5ms | < 10ms | < 25ms |
| Consensus Round | < 20ms | < 50ms | < 100ms | < 250ms |

### Throughput Requirements

| Operation | Minimum Ops/Sec |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Vertex Addition | 1,000 |
| Vertex Retrieval | 10,000 |
| Signature Generation | 500 |
| Encryption Operations | 1,000 |
| Consensus Votes | 5,000 |

### Memory Requirements

### Release Criteria

Before any release:
1. All tests passing (zero failures)
2. Coverage targets met
3. Performance benchmarks passed
4. Security scan clean
5. Size requirements met
6. Compatibility verified
7. Documentation updated

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Metrics to Track

- Test execution time trends

## Exception Process

If any criteria cannot be met:
1. Document the exception with justification
2. Implement compensating controls
3. Get approval from tech lead

5. Re-evaluate in next release cycle

## Success Metrics

The test suite is considered successful when:
- 100% of criteria are met or have approved exceptions
- Zero critical/high severity bugs in production
- Performance meets or exceeds targets
- Developer confidence in test coverage is high
- Test maintenance burden is manageable

## Review and Updates

This document should be reviewed and updated:
- Before each major release
- When new features are added
- When performance requirements change
- After security incidents
- Based on production metrics
