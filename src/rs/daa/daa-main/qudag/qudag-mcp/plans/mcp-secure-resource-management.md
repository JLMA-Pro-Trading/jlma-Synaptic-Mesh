# MCP Secure Resource Management for Vault Operations

## Executive Summary

This document outlines comprehensive research and design patterns for implementing secure resource management within the Model Context Protocol (MCP) framework specifically for password vault and sensitive data operations. The research covers encrypted resource schemas, access control mechanisms, and secure lifecycle management patterns that ensure vault data remains protected throughout its entire operational lifecycle.

## 1. Research Context and Scope

### 1.1 MCP Resource Security Challenges

The Model Context Protocol presents unique challenges when handling sensitive vault data:

- **Resource Exposure Risk**: Standard MCP resources may inadvertently expose sensitive data in logs or transport layers
- **State Management Security**: Maintaining secure state across MCP sessions without persisting sensitive data inappropriately
- **Cross-Protocol Security**: Ensuring security when MCP resources interact with other protocols or systems
- **Memory Security**: Preventing sensitive data from remaining in memory after operations complete

### 1.2 Vault-Specific Security Requirements

Password vaults require specialized security considerations:

- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: The MCP server should never have access to unencrypted vault data
- **Temporal Security**: Sensitive data should exist in memory for minimal time periods
- **Audit Trail Integrity**: All access and modifications must be logged without exposing sensitive content
- **Cryptographic Key Isolation**: Encryption keys must never be stored alongside encrypted data

## 2. Secure MCP Resource Patterns

### 2.1 Encrypted Resource Schema Design

#### Core Encrypted Resource Structure

```json
{
  "resource_type": "encrypted_vault_entry",
  "resource_id": "vault://secure/{uuid}",
  "metadata": {
    "creation_timestamp": "ISO8601",
    "last_modified": "ISO8601",
    "access_level": "user|admin|system",
    "encryption_version": "v2.1",
    "key_derivation_method": "argon2id",
    "integrity_hash": "blake3_hash"
  },
  "encrypted_payload": {
    "cipher": "chacha20poly1305",
    "nonce": "base64_encoded_24_bytes",
    "ciphertext": "base64_encoded_encrypted_data",
    "auth_tag": "base64_encoded_16_bytes"
  },
  "access_control": {
    "required_permissions": ["vault.read", "vault.decrypt"],
    "access_history": "encrypted_audit_trail",
    "time_based_access": {
      "valid_from": "ISO8601",
      "valid_until": "ISO8601",
      "max_access_count": 100
    }
  }
}
```

      "delete": ["dual_approval", "audit_mandatory"]
    },
    "context_requirements": {
      "location_restriction": "geo_fence_or_network_restriction",
      "time_restriction": "business_hours_or_maintenance_windows",
      "concurrent_session_limit": "single_session_per_user"
    }
  }
}
```

**Layer 3: Cryptographic Access Control**
```json
{
  "crypto_access": {
    "key_derivation_context": {
      "user_passphrase": "pbkdf2_or_argon2_derived",
      "hardware_key": "yubikey_or_tpm_based",
      "biometric_factor": "fingerprint_or_face_recognition"
    },
    "key_escrow": {
      "recovery_shares": "shamir_secret_sharing",
      "corporate_recovery": "admin_override_with_audit",
      "emergency_access": "break_glass_procedures"
    }
  }
}
```
