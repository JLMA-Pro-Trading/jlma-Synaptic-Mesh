#### B. QuDAG System Optimization Recommendations

1. **DNS Resolution Optimization**
   ```python
   # Implement multi-level caching
   - L1: In-memory LRU cache (8μs access)
   - L2: Redis distributed cache (100μs access)
   - L3: DNS server cache (1ms access)
   
   # Batch DNS resolution
   async def batch_resolve(domains: List[str]) -> List[str]:
       # Check L1 cache
       results = {}
       uncached = []
       for domain in domains:
           if cached := l1_cache.get(domain):
               results[domain] = cached
           else:
               uncached.append(domain)
       
       # Batch resolve uncached
       if uncached:
           resolved = await dns_client.batch_resolve(uncached)
           for domain, ip in resolved.items():
               l1_cache.put(domain, ip)
               results[domain] = ip
       
       return results
   ```

2. **Cryptographic Operation Optimization**
   ```python
   # Use SIMD instructions for parallel fingerprint generation
   # Pre-allocate buffers for crypto operations
   # Implement specialized batch verification
   
   class OptimizedCrypto:
       def __init__(self):
           self.buffer_pool = BufferPool(size=1024*1024, count=100)
       
       async def batch_verify_fingerprints(self, fingerprints: List[bytes]) -> List[bool]:
           # Allocate from pool
           buffer = self.buffer_pool.allocate()
           
           # Use SIMD operations for parallel verification
           results = simd_batch_verify(fingerprints, buffer)
           
           # Return buffer to pool
           self.buffer_pool.deallocate(buffer)
           
           return results
   ```

3. **Network Routing Optimization**
   ```python
   # Pre-compute routing tables for frequent destinations
   # Implement connection pooling
   # Use zero-copy networking where possible
   
   class OptimizedRouter:
       def __init__(self):
           self.routing_cache = {}
           self.connection_pool = ConnectionPool(max_size=1000)
       
       async def route_message(self, dest: str, message: bytes):
           # Check pre-computed route
           if route := self.routing_cache.get(dest):
               conn = await self.connection_pool.get_connection(route[0])
               await conn.send_zero_copy(message)
           else:
               # Compute and cache route
               route = await self.compute_route(dest)
               self.routing_cache[dest] = route
               await self.route_message(dest, message)
   ```
