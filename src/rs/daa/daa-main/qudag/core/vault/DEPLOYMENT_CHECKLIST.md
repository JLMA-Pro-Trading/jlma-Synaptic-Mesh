### ‚ùå Blockers
- [ ] **Dependency Issue**: Path dependencies must be resolved
  - `qudag-crypto = { path = "../crypto" }`
  - `qudag-dag = { path = "../dag" }`
  
  **Resolution Options:**
  1. Publish `qudag-crypto` and `qudag-dag` to crates.io first
  2. Create a standalone version by vendoring required code
  3. Make these optional features for initial release

### üìã Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Resolve dependency blockers
- [ ] Run `cargo publish --dry-run` successfully
- [ ] Verify all tests pass: `cargo test`
- [ ] Verify benchmarks run: `cargo bench`
- [ ] Build documentation: `cargo doc --no-deps --open`
- [ ] Add examples directory with working examples
- [ ] Final version number decision (recommend: 0.1.0)
- [ ] Create git tag: `git tag qudag-vault-v0.1.0`
- [ ] Publish to crates.io: `cargo publish`

## Post-deployment Tasks
- [ ] Update QuDAG main README to mention the published crate
- [ ] Create GitHub release with changelog
- [ ] Announce on relevant forums/communities
- [ ] Monitor crates.io for initial feedback

## Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate**: Publish dependencies or create standalone version
2. **Before v0.2.0**: Add more examples and improve documentation
3. **Future**: Consider WASM support for browser usage
