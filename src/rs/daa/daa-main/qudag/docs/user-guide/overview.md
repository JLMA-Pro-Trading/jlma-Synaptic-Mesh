# QuDAG Overview

## What is QuDAG?

QuDAG (Quantum-resistant Directed Acyclic Graph) is a cutting-edge communication protocol designed for secure, anonymous communication in a post-quantum world. It combines DAG-based consensus with quantum-resistant cryptography to provide a robust and future-proof messaging infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Quantum Resistance**: Built on NIST-approved post-quantum cryptographic algorithms
- **Anonymous Communication**: DAG-based routing for enhanced privacy
- **High Performance**: Optimized for low latency and high throughput
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for linear scalability with network growth
- **Security-First Design**: Comprehensive security measures at all layers

## Architecture Overview

QuDAG consists of four core components:

1. **Cryptographic Layer**: Post-quantum primitives (ML-KEM, ML-DSA, HQC)
2. **DAG Consensus**: QR-Avalanche algorithm for fast finality
3. **Network Layer**: P2P networking with anonymous routing
4. **Protocol Layer**: High-level protocol coordination

## Use Cases

- **Secure Messaging**: End-to-end encrypted communication
- **Anonymous Networks**: Privacy-preserving network infrastructure
- **Distributed Systems**: Quantum-resistant consensus mechanisms
- **Data Protection**: Future-proof data security solutions
