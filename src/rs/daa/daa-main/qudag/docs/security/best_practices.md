# QuDAG Security Best Practices Guide

This guide outlines comprehensive security best practices for deploying and operating QuDAG nodes. Following these guidelines is essential for maintaining a secure and reliable network.

## Key Management

### Private Key Storage
- Store private keys in hardware security modules (HSMs) when available
- Use secure key storage solutions like system keyrings or encrypted storage
- Never store private keys in plaintext files
- Implement key rotation policies with configurable timeframes
- Use memory protection mechanisms to prevent key exposure in core dumps

### Key Generation
- Use cryptographically secure random number generators (CSPRNG)
- Generate keys in isolated environments
- Verify entropy sources before key generation
- Document all key generation procedures
- Implement secure backup procedures for critical keys

### Access Control
- Implement principle of least privilege for key access
- Use access control lists (ACLs) for key operations
- Monitor and audit all key usage
- Establish key revocation procedures
- Maintain separate keys for different operations (signing, encryption)

## Network Security

### Node Communication
- Enforce authenticated and encrypted connections between nodes
- Implement perfect forward secrecy for all connections
- Use secure protocol negotiation
- Monitor for connection anomalies
- Implement rate limiting for all network operations

### Firewall Configuration
- Allow only required ports and protocols
- Implement ingress and egress filtering
- Use stateful packet inspection
- Configure DoS/DDoS protection
- Regularly audit firewall rules

### Traffic Analysis Protection
- Enable anonymous routing features
- Use traffic padding to prevent size analysis
- Implement random delays to prevent timing analysis
- Configure mix-net capabilities when available
- Monitor for traffic analysis attempts

## Secure Configuration

### Node Configuration
- Use secure default settings
- Disable unnecessary features and services
- Implement configuration validation
- Document all security-relevant settings
- Maintain configuration version control

### System Hardening
- Update system packages regularly
- Remove unnecessary software
- Configure secure boot if available
- Implement file system encryption
- Enable security-enhanced Linux (SELinux) or AppArmor

### Monitoring and Logging
- Enable secure logging mechanisms
- Implement log rotation and encryption
- Configure intrusion detection
- Monitor system resources
- Establish incident response procedures

## Runtime Security

### Memory Protection
- Enable address space layout randomization (ASLR)
- Configure stack protections
- Implement secure memory wiping
- Monitor for memory-based attacks
- Use memory-safe programming practices

### Process Isolation
- Run services with minimal privileges
- Use containerization when appropriate
- Implement process resource limits
- Configure process monitoring
- Enable mandatory access control

## Security Updates

### Update Management
- Establish update verification procedures
- Implement automated security updates
- Maintain update rollback capabilities
- Document update procedures
- Test updates in staging environment

### Vulnerability Management
- Monitor security advisories
- Implement vulnerability scanning
- Maintain security patch procedures
- Document incident response plans
- Conduct regular security audits

## Additional Considerations

### Physical Security
- Secure physical access to nodes
- Implement secure boot procedures
- Use trusted platform modules (TPM)
- Document physical security procedures
- Regular physical security audits

### Backup and Recovery
- Implement secure backup procedures
- Test recovery procedures regularly
- Encrypt all backups
- Maintain offline backup copies
- Document recovery procedures

## Security Testing

### Regular Testing
- Conduct penetration testing
- Implement security regression tests
- Perform regular security audits
- Test incident response procedures
- Validate security configurations

### Compliance
- Document compliance requirements
- Implement compliance monitoring
- Regular compliance audits
- Maintain compliance documentation
- Update procedures for new requirements
