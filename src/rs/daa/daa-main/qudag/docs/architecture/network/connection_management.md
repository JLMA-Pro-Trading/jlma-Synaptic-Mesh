# Connection Management and Security

The QuDAG network layer implements robust connection management with strong security measures using QUIC protocol and quantum-resistant cryptography.

## Connection Architecture

### SecureConnection

The secure connection implementation provides:

1. **Transport Security**
   - QUIC protocol for reliable, encrypted transport
   - Quantum-resistant cryptographic primitives
   - Forward secrecy using ephemeral keys

2. **Key Management**
   - Dynamic key generation using X25519
   - Secure key storage and rotation
   - Automatic key cleanup

3. **Message Encryption**
   - ChaCha20-Poly1305 for message encryption
   - Authenticated encryption (AEAD)
   - Zero-copy encryption where possible

### Connection Manager

The `ConnectionManager` handles connection lifecycle:

1. **Connection Limits**
   - Configurable maximum concurrent connections
   - Connection prioritization
   - Resource management

2. **State Management**
   - Connection status tracking
   - State transitions
   - Error handling

3. **Metrics Collection**
   - Connection count monitoring
   - Message throughput tracking
   - Latency measurements

## Security Features

### Transport Layer Security

1. **QUIC Protocol**
   - Built-in encryption
   - 0-RTT connection establishment
   - Automatic connection migration
   - Flow control

2. **Encryption**
   - ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD
   - Ring crypto library integration
   - Constant-time operations

### Connection Hardening

1. **Timeouts and Keepalives**
   - Configurable connection timeouts
   - Regular keepalive messages
   - Automatic reconnection

2. **Resource Protection**
   - Connection limits
   - Backpressure mechanisms
   - Resource cleanup

## Performance Considerations

1. **Connection Pooling**
   - Reuse of established connections
   - Connection warm-up
   - Graceful shutdown

2. **Metrics and Monitoring**
   - Real-time performance tracking
   - Latency monitoring
   - Throughput measurement

3. **Resource Management**
   - Memory usage optimization
   - Connection lifecycle management
   - Automatic resource cleanup
