**Executive Summary: QuDAG Exchange**

The **QuDAG Exchange** is a modular, quantum-secure, multi-agent resource exchange protocol designed to power the next generation of autonomous, peer-to-peer computation. At its core is a novel utility credit called **rUv** — short for *Resource Utilization Voucher* — which quantifies computational value across a distributed swarm of agents. Agents earn rUv by contributing CPU, GPU, memory, storage, and bandwidth to the network, and spend it to access agent-driven capabilities, such as parallel computation, smart routing, or secure data handling.

Built in Rust with full WASM compatibility, QuDAG Exchange integrates directly with the **QuDAG Vault** (for quantum-resistant identity and secure key management) and the **QuDAG DAG** consensus layer (using a QR-Avalanche protocol for scalable, non-linear transaction finality). It supports CLI, API, and browser-based WASM clients, allowing seamless deployment across desktop, cloud, and edge environments.

Development is orchestrated by a 10-agent autonomous swarm, each specialized in roles such as testing, implementation, optimization, and verification. This swarm uses a fully test-driven development (TDD) loop and parallel task coordination to continuously build, validate, and optimize the system. Swarm decisions are governed through a task-routing system backed by version control and code simulation.

Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) ensure that all transactions and resource contributions can be verified without revealing sensitive metadata. A vault-based wallet system provides secure and anonymous management of rUv credits, with built-in support for fee distribution, consensus voting, and rUv-metered execution.

Designed for long-term extensibility and post-quantum survivability, QuDAG Exchange provides a trustless infrastructure for AI-driven economic coordination — forming the foundation of a truly decentralized, agent-centric computation marketplace. It represents a critical step toward enabling autonomous systems to collaborate, trade, and evolve entirely on their own.
