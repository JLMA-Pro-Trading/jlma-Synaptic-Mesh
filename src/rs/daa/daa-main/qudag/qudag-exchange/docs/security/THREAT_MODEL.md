# QuDAG Exchange Security Threat Model

## Overview

The QuDAG Exchange is designed to be a quantum-secure, decentralized resource exchange protocol resistant to both classical and quantum attacks. This document outlines the threat model, security assumptions, and mitigation strategies.

## Security Goals

1. **Quantum Resistance**: All cryptographic operations must be secure against quantum computers
2. **Zero-Knowledge Privacy**: Transaction details remain private while being verifiable
3. **Timing Attack Resistance**: No information leakage through execution time variations
4. **DoS Resistance**: System remains available under attack
5. **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Correct operation with up to 1/3 malicious nodes

## Threat Categories

### 1. Cryptographic Attacks

#### 1.1 Quantum Computing Threats
- **Threat**: Quantum computers breaking classical cryptography
- **Mitigation**: 
  - ML-DSA (NIST-approved quantum-resistant signatures)
  - ML-KEM-768 (quantum-resistant key encapsulation)
  - HQC (backup quantum-resistant encryption)
  - BLAKE3 (quantum-resistant hashing)

#### 1.2 Timing Attacks
- **Threat**: Information leakage through execution time analysis
- **Mitigation**:
  - Constant-time cryptographic operations
  - `subtle` crate for constant-time comparisons
  - Timing guards with variance detection
  - No early returns in sensitive code paths

#### 1.3 Side-Channel Attacks
- **Threat**: Cache timing, power analysis, electromagnetic emissions
- **Mitigation**:
  - Memory access pattern obfuscation
  - Constant-time operations
  - No conditional branches on secret data
  - Secure memory zeroization

### 2. Network Attacks

#### 2.1 Denial of Service (DoS)
- **Threat**: Resource exhaustion, flooding attacks
- **Mitigation**:
  - Rate limiting (configurable per-second limits)
  - Resource metering for all operations
  - Connection limits per peer
  - Proof-of-work for certain operations

#### 2.2 Sybil Attacks
- **Threat**: Creating multiple fake identities
- **Mitigation**:
  - Proof-of-stake requirements
  - Resource-based reputation system
  - Identity verification through vault system

#### 2.3 Eclipse Attacks
- **Threat**: Isolating nodes from honest network
- **Mitigation**:
  - Diverse peer discovery mechanisms
  - Minimum peer diversity requirements
  - Onion routing for censorship resistance

### 3. Transaction Security

#### 3.1 Double Spending
- **Threat**: Spending the same rUv credits multiple times
- **Mitigation**:
  - DAG consensus with finality guarantees
  - Transaction ordering enforcement
  - Spent transaction tracking

#### 3.2 Replay Attacks
- **Threat**: Replaying valid transactions
- **Mitigation**:
  - Nonce-based replay prevention
  - Time-bounded transaction validity
  - Chain-specific transaction binding

#### 3.3 Front-Running
- **Threat**: Exploiting transaction ordering
- **Mitigation**:
  - Commit-reveal schemes for sensitive operations
  - Zero-knowledge proofs for transaction privacy
  - Fair ordering through consensus

### 4. Smart Contract/Agent Security

#### 4.1 Resource Exhaustion
- **Threat**: Malicious agents consuming excessive resources
- **Mitigation**:
  - Resource metering and limits
  - Gas-like execution costs
  - Automatic termination of runaway processes

#### 4.2 Data Injection
- **Threat**: SQL injection, XSS, command injection
- **Mitigation**:
  - Strict input validation
  - Parameterized queries only
  - Sandboxed execution environments

### 5. Key Management

#### 5.1 Key Compromise
- **Threat**: Private key theft or exposure
- **Mitigation**:
  - Hardware security module support
  - Key rotation mechanisms
  - Threshold signatures for critical operations
  - Secure key derivation (Argon2)

#### 5.2 Weak Randomness
- **Threat**: Predictable key generation
- **Mitigation**:
  - OS-provided CSPRNG
  - Additional entropy sources
  - Randomness health checks

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth

1. **Application Layer**
   - Input validation
   - Rate limiting
   - Access control

2. **Protocol Layer**
   - Authenticated encryption
   - Zero-knowledge proofs
   - Consensus validation

3. **Network Layer**

   - Secure defaults

### Security Primitives

```rust
// All operations must use these security primitives

// Timing-safe comparison
use subtle::ConstantTimeEq;

// Automatic secret zeroization
use zeroize::{Zeroize, ZeroizeOnDrop};

// Quantum-resistant crypto
use qudag_crypto::{MlDsa, MlKem768, Hqc};

// Rate limiting
use qudag_exchange::security::RateLimiter;

// Nonce management
use qudag_exchange::security::NonceManager;
```

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- Timing attack tests (see `timing_attack_tests.rs`)
- Fuzzing with `cargo-fuzz`
- Property-based testing with `proptest`
- Static analysis with `cargo-audit`

### Manual Testing
- Penetration testing
- Code review by security experts
- Formal verification of critical paths

## Incident Response

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring for anomalies
2. **Containment**: Automatic circuit breakers
3. **Investigation**: Comprehensive audit logs
4. **Recovery**: State rollback capabilities
5. **Post-Mortem**: Security updates and patches

## Security Assumptions

1. Cryptographic primitives are correctly implemented
2. Operating system provides secure randomness
3. Hardware is not compromised
4. At least 2/3 of network nodes are honest
5. Quantum computers of sufficient size do not yet exist

## Compliance

- NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standards
- OWASP security guidelines
- Common Criteria evaluation (planned)
- SOC 2 Type II (planned)
