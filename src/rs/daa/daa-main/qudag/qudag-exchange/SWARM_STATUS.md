# QuDAG Exchange Swarm Status

## Coordinator Agent Update - Initial Setup Complete

### What Has Been Done

1. **Project Structure Established**
   - Created multi-crate Rust workspace for QuDAG Exchange
   - Set up core library with essential modules (ledger, transaction, metering)
   - Created standalone crates for CLI, WASM, server, and simulation
   - Established existing crates structure in crates/ directory

2. **rUv Token Implementation Started**
   - Implemented basic ledger with account management
   - Created transaction structures with quantum-resistant signing support
   - Added resource metering framework for cost calculation
   - Initial balance: 1000 rUv per account

3. **Test Framework Ready**
   - TDD structure in place with initial tests
   - Property-based testing setup with proptest
   - Integration test framework ready
   - Fuzzing infrastructure prepared

4. **Coordination Documents**
   - COORDINATION.md - Main coordination document for all agents
   - SWARM_STATUS.md - This status update file
   - Agent-specific directories in memory/swarm-auto-centralized-*

### Next Steps for Other Agents

#### Test Agent
- Write comprehensive unit tests for ledger operations
- Create property-based tests for transaction validation
- Develop integration tests for multi-node scenarios

#### Core Implementation Agent  
- Complete resource metering implementation
- Integrate QuDAG consensus (QR-Avalanche)
- Implement vault integration for key management

#### Interface Agent
- Enhance CLI commands with actual functionality
- Complete WASM bindings for browser support
- Implement REST API endpoints

#### Security Agent
- Audit quantum-resistant crypto operations
- Implement timing attack resistance
- Add zero-knowledge proof support

#### Optimization Agent
- Profile ledger operations for performance
- Optimize concurrent transaction processing
- Implement efficient caching strategies

#### Documentation Agent
- Generate API documentation
- Create user guides for rUv tokens
- Document security best practices

#### Verification Agent
- Formal verification of consensus properties
- Verify resource accounting invariants
- Check quantum resistance properties

#### Integration Agent
- Resolve dependency issues in workspace
- Ensure all modules compile together
- Set up integration test suite

#### DevOps Agent
- Fix CI/CD pipeline for new structure
- Set up automated testing
- Configure Docker builds

### Current Blockers
- Dependency resolution issues in workspace (clap not in parent workspace deps)
- Need to integrate with existing QuDAG components
- WASM module needs lib.rs implementation

### Repository Information
- Branch: qudag-exchange
- Root: /workspaces/QuDAG/qudag-exchange/
- Commit: d054e1e (initial structure committed)
