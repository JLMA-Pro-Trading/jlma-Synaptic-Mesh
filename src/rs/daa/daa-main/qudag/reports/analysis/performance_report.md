## Critical Path Analysis

### Cryptographic Operations
- ML-KEM operations are CPU intensive and should be optimized with:
  - Hardware acceleration (AVX2/AVX-512)
  - Constant-time implementations
  - Memory-efficient algorithms

### DAG Consensus
- Consensus algorithms should be optimized with:
  - Parallel processing of independent operations
  - Efficient graph traversal algorithms
  - Caching of frequently accessed data

### Network Layer
- Network performance should be optimized with:
  - Connection pooling and reuse
  - Batch message processing
  - Asynchronous I/O and zero-copy optimizations

## Optimization Recommendations

1. **Memory Management**
   - Implement memory pooling for frequently allocated objects
   - Use arena allocators for short-lived objects
   - Implement compression for network messages

2. **CPU Optimization**
   - Profile and optimize hot paths with perf/flamegraph
   - Use SIMD instructions for cryptographic operations
   - Implement multi-threading for parallel operations

3. **I/O Optimization**
   - Use async/await for all I/O operations
   - Implement connection pooling and multiplexing
   - Use zero-copy techniques where possible

4. **Algorithm Optimization**
   - Implement efficient data structures (B-trees, tries)
   - Use caching for frequently computed values
   - Optimize graph algorithms for DAG operations
