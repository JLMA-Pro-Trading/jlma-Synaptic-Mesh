Key innovations:
- Quantum discord measurement for true quantum advantage
- GHZ states for multi-party entanglement
- Quantum teleportation of expertise between experts
- Emergent quantum behaviors detection

### 2. Stigmergic GPU Memory Communication

Inspired by ant colonies and termite swarms, our stigmergic protocol enables indirect coordination through environmental traces:

- **GPU Shared Memory Pheromones**: Multi-dimensional pheromone grids in high-performance memory

### 3. Emergent Consensus Through Chaos

Our consensus protocol harnesses chaos theory and complex systems dynamics:
