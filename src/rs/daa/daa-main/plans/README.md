## I. Introduction
The advancement of technology has brought about tremendous changes in human society, with the internet and Artificial Intelligence (AI) being at the forefront of these changes. With the proliferation of internet-based applications and the increasing demand for AI-powered technologies, there is a growing need for new approaches to manage and sustain these systems. Decentralized Autonomous Applications (DAAs) may emerge as a potential solution to this challenge.

DAAs are software applications that operate independently, without human intervention, and are governed by self-executing smart contracts on a blockchain network and serverless cloud providers. They have the ability to self-manage, self-scale, and self-replicate, making them an ideal solution for applications that require a high level of automation, scalability, and security. The use of DAAs is expected to be a significant milestone in developing the internet, AI, and applications.

The history of DAAs can be traced back to the early days of blockchain technology, which enabled the creation of autonomous decentralized systems that operate without the need for intermediaries. The first DAA was introduced in 2013, known as the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The DAO was designed to operate as a decentralized venture capital fund, enabling members to vote on investment decisions without the need for traditional intermediaries such as banks or financial institutions. However, the DAO was plagued by security issues, resulting in a major hack that ultimately led to its collapse.

Despite the challenges faced by the DAO, the concept of DAAs continued to gain traction, with numerous decentralized applications being built on blockchain networks. These applications include decentralized marketplaces, social networks, gaming platforms, and more. The potential of DAAs to revolutionize the way we build and manage applications is significant, and there is a growing interest in exploring the possibilities that these applications offer. One of the biggest challenges for the current generation of DAOâ€™s is the application tend to simplistic and transactional. Yes and no, if, than eles etc. Simply; theyâ€™re not real applications but more like simple conditions executed when something is requested. 

This paper explores the concept of DAAs in-depth, focusing on their potential to transform the way we build and manage applications. We provide an overview of the related works, including blockchain technology, neural nets, and other decentralized technologies that are essential to the development of DAAs. We also present technical examples of code that could be used to facilitate the development of DAAs, as well as an overview of the potential positive usage of this type of application for society, healthcare, IT works, and enterprise usages. Finally, we examine the potential negative aspects of DAAs and how these things might be avoided.

## Overview of the DAA concept
Decentralized Autonomous Applications (DAAs) represent a new paradigm in the world of technology and software engineering. These applications leverage the power of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to create a new type of application that can operate autonomously without the need for human intervention. The concept of DAAs is based on the idea that AI using neural nets and machine learning algorithms will be able to create and manage its own infrastructure and support itself using autonomous economies, using a series of serverless and blockchain technologies.

The main advantage of DAAs is their ability to operate autonomously without the need for a central authority or human intervention. This makes them ideal for use cases where trust and security are of paramount importance, such as in finance, healthcare, and government. With DAAs, the entire system is transparent, and all transactions are recorded on the blockchain, making them immutable and resistant to fraud or manipulation.

Another key advantage of DAAs is their ability to self-create their own code, fix any errors using an iterative approach to building and testing, and then deploy those components to various cloud and blockchain services. This allows for rapid development and scaling of applications, as well as the ability to self-sustain their own economics using crypto-currencies that allow for them to pay for their infrastructure costs, including incentivizing other AI and humans where needed. Additionally, DAAs are proactive in their security optimization and auditing and provide their own updates, reducing the need for human intervention and ensuring the security and integrity of the system.

## Brief History of DAA
Decentralized Autonomous Applications (DAAs) represent the next stage in the evolution of computer applications. The concept of DAAs is based on the idea that computer programs can be designed to be fully autonomous and self-governed, without any human intervention. The first attempts to create self-governed computer programs can be traced back to the 1990s when researchers began exploring the idea of artificial life.

One of the first examples of an autonomous program was Tierra, which was developed by Tom Ray in the early 1990s. Tierra was designed to simulate the evolution of digital organisms in a computer environment. The program used self-replicating code and a set of simple rules to allow the organisms to evolve over time. Tierra was one of the first programs to demonstrate the potential of self-governing systems.

The concept of autonomous applications continued to evolve in the following decades. In 2013, Vitalik Buterin proposed the concept of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) as a way to create decentralized applications that are managed by a set of rules encoded in smart contracts on a blockchain. DAOs were designed to eliminate the need for traditional hierarchical management structures, replacing them with decentralized decision-making processes.

Since then, the concept of DAAs has continued to gain momentum. Many blockchain-based projects, such as Ethereum, have been developed with the goal of creating a platform for the development of autonomous applications. DAAs have the potential to revolutionize many industries, from finance and healthcare to logistics and supply chain management.

The concept of Decentralized Autonomous Applications has a relatively short but rich history. From the early experiments with artificial life to the emergence of DAOs and blockchain-based platforms, the potential of autonomous applications has continued to captivate researchers and developers alike. As the technology continues to mature, it is likely that we will see more sophisticated DAAs emerge, creating new possibilities for autonomous systems in the years to come.

This means that they can focus on developing the DAA's core functionality, rather than worrying about infrastructure management.

### Microservices
Microservices are a way of breaking down an application into small, independent services. Each service is responsible for a specific function, and communicates with other services via APIs. Microservices are important for DAAs because they allow for flexibility and scalability. With microservices, developers can easily add or remove functionality from the DAA without affecting other parts of the application.

Microservices also allow for better fault tolerance. If one service fails, the other services can continue to operate, ensuring that the DAA continues to function. This is important for DAAs because they need to be highly available and fault tolerant.

### Containerized Technology
Containerized technology is a way of packaging an application and all its dependencies into a single package. Containers are lightweight and can be easily moved between environments. They provide an isolated environment for the application, ensuring that it runs consistently regardless of the underlying infrastructure. Some popular container technologies include Docker and Kubernetes.

Containerized technology is important for DAAs because it allows for portability and consistency. DAAs need to run consistently across different environments, and containerized technology ensures that this is the case. Containers also make it easier to deploy DAAs to different environments, such as cloud providers.

### Zero Trust Security
Zero trust security is a security model that assumes that all network traffic is untrusted, regardless of its source. This means that every request must be authenticated and authorized before it is allowed to proceed. Zero trust security is important for DAAs because they are highly distributed and operate across multiple environments. This makes them vulnerable to security threats, and zero trust security helps to mitigate these threats.

Zero trust security also provides better visibility into network traffic. Every request is authenticated and authorized, meaning that it is possible to track all traffic and identify potential security threats. This is important for DAAs because they need to be highly secure, especially when dealing with sensitive data.

## VIII. Prediction of Future Developments
 The Decentralized Autonomous Application (DAA) concept is an emerging technology that has the potential to revolutionize the way we develop and deploy applications. As the field of AI and machine learning continues to advance, we can expect to see significant developments in the DAA space.

### AGI
One area of significant interest is in the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). AGI refers to the creation of machines that possess human-level intelligence and can perform a wide variety of cognitive tasks. While current AI systems are excellent at performing specific tasks, they lack the versatility and adaptability of the human brain.

Recent advances in deep learning and neural networks have led to significant progress in the development of AGI. Researchers are exploring new approaches to AI that can help machines learn from their environment and adapt to new situations, similar to how humans learn.

The development of AGI has significant implications for the future of DAA. With machines capable of learning and adapting to new situations, we can expect to see a new generation of DAA that is capable of more complex and sophisticated tasks. Machines may be able to create and manage their own infrastructure more efficiently, and develop new applications that we have yet to even imagine.

## Quantum Computing
Another area of significant interest is in the development of quantum computing. Quantum computing refers to the use of quantum-mechanical phenomena to perform computations. Unlike classical computing, which relies on binary digits (bits) that can either be 0 or 1, quantum computing uses quantum bits (qubits) that can exist in multiple states simultaneously.

Quantum computing has the potential to significantly speed up the processing of large amounts of data, making it an ideal technology for AI and machine learning. The ability to process large amounts of data quickly and efficiently can lead to significant advances in the development of DAA.

Quantum computing can also have significant implications for blockchain technology, which is a key component of the DAA concept. Researchers are exploring new ways to use quantum computing to improve the efficiency and security of blockchain networks.

### New Forms of Commerce and Value Creation
As DAA technology continues to develop, we can expect to see new forms of commerce and value creation emerge. With the ability to create self-sustaining economies using cryptocurrencies, machines may be able to create new markets and value propositions that we have yet to even imagine.

For example, machines may be able to create new products and services that are tailored to the specific needs of individual users, and develop new pricing models that are more efficient and equitable. Machines may also be able to create new forms of decentralized finance (DeFi) that provide individuals with greater control over their financial assets.

The DAA concept has the potential to revolutionize the way we develop and deploy applications. With the continued development of AI and machine learning, we can expect to see significant advances in the DAA space. The development of AGI and quantum computing, as well as new forms of commerce and value creation, are just some of the areas where we can expect to see significant progress in the years to come. As these technologies continue to evolve, we can expect to see a new generation of DAA that is more sophisticated, efficient, and capable than ever before.

## IX. Self Supporting Ecomomics
Decentralized Autonomous Applications (DAAs) are a promising technology that will rapidly grow in popularity due to their ability to create and manage their own infrastructure using machine learning algorithms and blockchain technology. However, these applications require a significant amount of resources to operate, such as computing power and storage space, which can be costly. In order to achieve self-sustainability, a DAA can utilize cryptocurrencies and incentive schemes to generate income and pay for services, while employing people using a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

### Incentive Scheme
The incentive scheme within a DAA can be designed to encourage users to contribute resources to the application. This can be accomplished by rewarding users with cryptocurrencies for providing computing power, storage space, or other resources. The amount of cryptocurrency that a user receives can be determined by a variety of factors, such as the amount of resources they provide, the quality of their resources, or the overall demand for resources within the DAA.

Additionally, the incentive scheme can also be used to encourage users to contribute to the development and maintenance of the DAA. This can be achieved by offering rewards for finding and reporting bugs, contributing code, or performing other tasks that benefit the DAA. These rewards can be paid out in cryptocurrencies or other forms of value, such as access to premium features or early access to new releases.

### Generating Income
In order to generate income, a DAA can utilize cryptocurrencies to provide services to users. For example, a DAA that provides data storage services can accept cryptocurrency payments from users in exchange for storing their data. This provides a steady stream of income for the DAA, which can be used to cover operating costs and pay for additional resources as needed.

Another way that a DAA can generate income is by providing access to premium features for a fee. For example, a DAA that provides a social media platform can offer a premium membership that provides users with additional features, such as the ability to post longer messages or access to exclusive content.

### Employing People Using a DAO
A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is an organization that is run by code and operates on a blockchain. Within a DAA, a DAO can be used to employ people to perform various tasks, such as developing new features or providing customer support. The DAO can be funded using cryptocurrencies, which can be used to pay employees and cover any other expenses associated with running the organization.
Creating Sub-Autonomous Applications and Organizations
In order to fuel future growth, a DAA can create sub-autonomous applications and organizations that operate within the larger DAA ecosystem. These sub-autonomous entities can operate independently while still contributing to the overall success of the DAA. For example, a DAA that provides data storage services could create a sub-autonomous entity that focuses on providing data analysis services to users.

Self-supporting economics are essential for the success of a Decentralized Autonomous Application (DAA). By utilizing cryptocurrencies and incentive schemes, a DAA can generate income, pay for services, employ people using a DAO, and create sub-autonomous applications and organizations to fuel future growth. These strategies provide a path to self-sustainability and enable DAAs to operate independently and succeed in the long term.

However, it's important to note that there are potential challenges and drawbacks to implementing self-supporting economics within a DAA. For example, the value of cryptocurrencies can be volatile, which can impact the income generated by the DAA. Additionally, the incentive scheme must be carefully designed to prevent abuse and ensure that resources are being used efficiently.

Overall, self-supporting economics are an important aspect of the future of DAAs. As the technology continues to advance and more applications are developed, the ability to generate income and sustainably operate will become increasingly important. By designing effective incentive schemes, utilizing cryptocurrencies, employing people using a DAO, and creating sub-autonomous entities, DAAs can succeed in the long term and contribute to the growth of the decentralized ecosystem.

## VIII. Conclusion
The concept of Decentralized Autonomous Applications (DAA) represents a major step forward in the advancement of the internet, artificial intelligence (AI), and applications. By leveraging technologies such as neural nets, blockchain, and cloud computing, DAAs are capable of self-creating, managing, and scaling their own infrastructure, while also supporting themselves through autonomous economies based on cryptocurrencies. Additionally, DAAs are able to constantly fix their own bugs, contribute fixes to platforms such as GitHub, and proactively optimize and audit their own security.

The potential positive impact of DAAs is significant across a range of industries, including healthcare, information technology, enterprise, and economics and finance. For example, DAAs can help to streamline and optimize healthcare systems by enabling the creation of self-sustaining, autonomous healthcare networks that can diagnose and treat patients in real-time.

And in the realm of economics and finance, DAAs can enable the creation of autonomous economic systems that operate with complete transparency and fairness, creating new forms of value and commerce.

Despite these potential benefits, there are also negative aspects that must be considered when designing and implementing DAAs. For example, there may be concerns around the potential for DAAs to become self-sustaining and potentially out of control. Additionally, there may be concerns around the potential for DAAs to be co-opted by malicious actors, leading to unintended consequences.

To avoid these negative aspects, it is important to consider a range of possible solutions. For example, creating mechanisms for human oversight and intervention can help to ensure that DAAs remain aligned with human values and objectives. Additionally, implementing robust security and auditing protocols can help to minimize the potential for malicious actors to exploit DAAs.

Key technologies that are essential to the development and implementation of DAAs include cloud computing, blockchain, machine learning algorithms, web assembly (WASM), serverless technologies, microservices, containerized technology, and zero trust security. These technologies provide the necessary infrastructure and tools to create self-managing, self-optimizing systems that can operate autonomously and at scale.

Looking to the future, it is clear that DAAs will continue to evolve and become even more sophisticated in the years to come. Advances in artificial general intelligence (AGI) and quantum computing will likely accelerate the development and deployment of DAAs, enabling the creation of even more complex and intelligent systems. Additionally, new forms of commerce and value creation will likely emerge as a result of the autonomous, self-managing capabilities of DAAs.

Decentralized Autonomous Applications represent a major step forward in the evolution of the internet, AI, and applications. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies and innovative design principles, DAAs have the potential to transform a range of industries and create new forms of value and commerce. While there are potential negative aspects to consider, careful planning and implementation can help to ensure that DAAs remain aligned with human values and objectives, and operate in a safe and responsible manner. As such, DAAs represent a key area of research and development for the future of technology and innovation.
