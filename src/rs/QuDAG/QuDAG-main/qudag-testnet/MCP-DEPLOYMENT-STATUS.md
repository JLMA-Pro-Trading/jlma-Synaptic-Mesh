# QuDAG MCP Deployment Status

## Current State (2025-06-23)

### Successfully Completed
1. **MCP Server Implementation** ‚úÖ
   - Full MCP server with HTTP, SSE, and JSON-RPC support
   - Available on port 3333 on all nodes
   - Working endpoints: discovery, tools, resources, events, RPC

2. **Intro Page Implementation** ‚úÖ
   - Beautiful intro page with node status and available endpoints
   - Successfully deployed to node1 (Toronto)
   - Accessible at https://qudag-testnet-node1.fly.dev/

3. **MCP Integration on Main HTTP Port** ‚úÖ
   - MCP endpoints integrated into port 8080
   - Available at /mcp/* paths on the main HTTP server

### Partially Working
1. **HTTPS Domain Access for MCP** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Direct port access works: http://109.105.222.156:3333/mcp
   - HTTPS proxy access has issues: https://qudag-testnet-node1.fly.dev/mcp
   - The request hangs after SSL handshake - likely a request parsing issue with HTTP/2

### Pending Deployment
1. **Nodes 2, 3, 4** üîÑ
   - Still running v1.0.0-enhanced
   - Need to be updated to v1.0.0-mcp-v2
   - Update script created: `update-all-nodes-to-v2.sh`

## Known Issues

### 1. HTTPS Proxy Request Handling
The HTTP server seems to have trouble parsing requests that come through Fly.io's HTTPS proxy. This might be due to:
- HTTP/2 vs HTTP/1.1 differences
- Request buffer size limitations
- Header parsing differences

### 2. Request Timeout on MCP Endpoints via HTTPS
When accessing https://qudag-testnet-node1.fly.dev/mcp, the request times out after establishing SSL connection.

## Solutions Implemented

### MCP Node v2
Created an enhanced node implementation with:
- Intro page handler at root path (/)
- Integrated MCP handling on main HTTP port (8080)
- All MCP endpoints accessible via standard HTTP paths
- Beautiful UI showing node status and available endpoints

### Docker Image
- Built as `qudag-mcp-node-v2:latest`
- Successfully deployed to node1
- Ready for deployment to other nodes

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy v2 to remaining nodes**:
   ```bash
   cd /workspaces/QuDAG/qudag-testnet
   ./update-all-nodes-to-v2.sh
   ```

2. **Fix HTTPS proxy handling** (if needed):
   - Investigate HTTP/2 request parsing
   - Increase request buffer size
   - Add better request logging

3. **Update documentation**:
   - Add MCP usage examples to README
   - Document the intro page features
   - Add troubleshooting guide for HTTPS access

## Access Methods

### Working Access Points
- **Direct MCP Port**: http://NODE_IP:3333/mcp
- **Intro Page**: https://qudag-testnet-node1.fly.dev/
- **Health Check**: https://qudag-testnet-node1.fly.dev/health
- **Status API**: https://qudag-testnet-node1.fly.dev/api/v1/status

### Problematic Access Points
- **HTTPS MCP**: https://qudag-testnet-node1.fly.dev/mcp (times out)
