# QuDAG Vault - Deployment Issues Summary

## Critical Blockers for crates.io Publication

### 1. Dependency Resolution
The vault depends on local path dependencies that must be resolved:
```toml
qudag-crypto = { path = "../crypto" }
qudag-dag = { path = "../dag" }
```

**Solutions:**
- Option A: Publish `qudag-crypto` and `qudag-dag` to crates.io first
- Option B: Vendor the required code into the vault crate
- Option C: Make quantum features optional with feature flags

### 2. Test Compilation Errors
Multiple test files have compilation errors:
- Missing imports for `Charset` enum
- Incorrect method calls (`.unwrap()` on String)
- Test modules not properly configured

**Action Required:** Fix all test compilation errors before publishing

### 3. Documentation Warnings
While documentation builds, there are warnings about missing docs:
- `dag_storage.rs` fields missing documentation
- Consider adding more comprehensive API documentation

## Quick Fix for Deployment

To quickly prepare for deployment, consider:

1. **Temporary Solution**: Comment out QuDAG dependencies and DAG features
2. **Create Standalone Version**: Extract only the essential vault functionality
3. **Feature Flags**: Make advanced features optional:
   ```toml
   [features]
   default = ["basic"]
   basic = []
   full = ["qudag-crypto", "qudag-dag"]
   ```

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Fix test compilation errors
2. Resolve dependency issues (publish deps or make standalone)
3. Run full test suite
4. Perform security audit
5. Tag release and publish

The vault implementation is solid, but needs dependency resolution before crates.io publication.
