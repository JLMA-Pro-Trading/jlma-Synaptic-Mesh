# Implementation Plan for QuDAG-Based Password Vault Library

## Project Structure & Dependencies

We will organize the project as a Rust workspace with modular crates (following QuDAG’s architecture), ensuring separation of concerns and future extensibility. A suggested structure:

* **`qudag-vault-core`** (library crate): Core vault logic and data structures. Integrates QuDAG modules for cryptography and DAG storage. Key dependencies:

  * *QuDAG Crates:* Use `qudag-crypto` for cryptographic primitives (Kyber KEM, Dilithium signatures, BLAKE3 hash) and `qudag-dag` for DAG data structures/consensus.
  * *Cryptography:* `pqc_kyber` (or via `qudag-crypto`) for Kyber key exchange; `pqc_dilithium` (or via `qudag-crypto`) for Dilithium signatures; `aes-gcm` (RustCrypto AEAD) for AES-256-GCM encryption; `rand`/`getrandom` for secure randomness.
  * *KDF & Memory Safety:* Use Argon2id (e.g. `argon2` crate) to derive vault encryption keys from user passwords, and employ `zeroize` to clear sensitive material from memory.
  * *Data Format:* `serde`/`serde_json` to serialize the vault DAG (for export/import). The vault content will be stored encrypted (fields like passwords encrypted with AES-256-GCM), so exported data remains secure.
  * *Logging & Error:* `thiserror` for error definitions, and `tracing` for logging (for debugging/audit trails).

* **`qudag-vault-cli`** (binary crate): Command-line interface for end-users, integrated into the existing QuDAG CLI framework. It will extend the `qudag` CLI with a `vault` command group (ensuring no conflicts with QuDAG’s current commands). Key dependencies:

  * `clap` (or QuDAG’s CLI utilities) for argument parsing and a consistent help system.
  * `rpassword` or similar for secure password prompts (to input master password without echo).
  * Relies on `qudag-vault-core` for all operations.

* **`qudag-vault-node`** (Node.js addon, optional crate): Exposes core APIs to Node.js via N-API. We plan to use the **napi-rs** framework which allows building Node add-ons in Rust without needing node-gyp. This crate will create N-API bindings for the core Vault functions.

* **`qudag-vault-python`** (Python module, optional crate): Exposes core APIs to Python. We will use **PyO3** to wrap the Rust library as a Python extension, and **maturin** for building & publishing wheels (with support for `pip` or the faster `uv` tool for installation). The Python package (e.g. `qudag_vault`) will provide a high-level interface similar to the Rust API.

This modular layout aligns with QuDAG’s design philosophy of keeping cryptography, data (DAG), and interface layers separate. It ensures the vault system is *QuDAG-native* – reusing QuDAG’s quantum-resistant crypto and DAG mechanisms – and is structured for security and performance.

## Rust API Design & Usage

The core of the library is a `Vault` struct providing high-level methods for vault operations. Internally, the vault maintains a **DAG of encrypted secrets**. Each secret (password entry) is a node in the DAG, which enables flexible relationships (e.g. an entry can belong to multiple categories or have multiple versions without cycles). The DAG structure leverages `qudag-dag` for efficient traversal and future consensus support. Basic operations include creating/opening a vault, adding secrets, retrieving secrets, and exporting/importing the vault data.

**Cryptographic Design:** When a new vault is created, a fresh symmetric **vault key** (256-bit) is generated to encrypt all secret data with AES-256-GCM (providing confidentiality and integrity). For a user-supplied master password, we derive a key with Argon2id (salted with a random salt) to encrypt the vault key. This way, the vault file contains an encrypted vault key and an encrypted DAG of secrets. On vault open, the master password decrypts the vault key (via Argon2id and AES-GCM), then the vault key decrypts individual secrets.

To integrate Post-Quantum security, we incorporate **Kyber** and **Dilithium** from QuDAG’s crypto suite. For example, when storing or sharing a vault in a client-server or multi-user scenario, the vault key can be wrapped with Kyber KEM: one can encapsulate the vault key with a user’s Kyber public key, so only their private key decapsulates it. Similarly, **Dilithium** may be used to sign vault contents or audit logs to ensure integrity/authenticity (especially in enterprise settings). While a single-user local vault might not require KEM exchange, our API is designed to accommodate hybrid encryption: e.g., an optional method `Vault::share(pubkey)` could produce an encapsulated vault key for that public key (enabling secure vault sharing). All cryptographic operations use quantum-resistant primitives provided by QuDAG (Kyber, Dilithium, BLAKE3), aligning with QuDAG’s security standards. We also mirror QuDAG’s best practices by using strong hashing (BLAKE3) and wiping sensitive data from memory after use (via `zeroize`).

**Vault DAG Structure:** Secrets are stored as nodes in a directed acyclic graph. For example, a “category” or folder can be a node that points to secret entry nodes, and an entry could have edges to multiple categories (making the structure a DAG rather than a simple tree). We maintain a special root node representing the vault itself; traversing the DAG from the root (or from a category node) yields all accessible secrets (this is the “DAG traversal” functionality in the API). The DAG can also record version history: each update to a secret can create a new node linked from the previous version node, allowing non-linear history (particularly useful if multiple users edit concurrently, creating branches to be resolved). The **Vault API** provides functions to navigate this graph (e.g. list children of a node, find a node by label, etc.). In the initial implementation, with a single user, DAG traversal is used for organizing and listing secrets (e.g. listing all secrets in a category by traversing that subgraph).

Below is a sketch of the **Rust API** with key methods and an example of usage:

```rust
// Core Vault data structures (simplified)
pub struct Vault {
    // Encrypted DAG of secrets; each node contains encrypted payload and metadata.
    dag: Dag<SecretNode>,            // SecretNode includes encrypted secret data
    master_hash: [u8; 32],           // Hash of master password (to verify on open)
    encrypted_vault_key: Vec<u8>,    // Vault key (AES key) encrypted with master key
    public_key: Option<KyberPublic>, // Optional PQC keys for sharing (Kyber public key)
    private_key: Option<KyberSecret>,
    // ... other fields like vault identifier, salt for KDF, etc.
}

// Each secret entry (node data in the DAG)
pub struct SecretEntry {
    pub label: String,        // e.g. "email/github"
    pub username: String,
    pub password: String,     // plaintext (when decrypted in memory)
    // ... perhaps other fields, e.g. URL, notes.
}

// Public API methods
impl Vault {
    /// Initialize a new vault, generating keys and an empty DAG.
    pub fn create(path: &str, master_password: &str) -> Result<Self, VaultError> { ... }

    /// Open an existing vault from storage, decrypting the vault key using the master password.
    pub fn open(path: &str, master_password: &str) -> Result<Self, VaultError> { ... }

    /// Add a new secret to the vault DAG. Optionally generates a password if not provided.
    pub fn add_secret(&mut self, label: &str, username: &str, password: Option<&str>) -> Result<(), VaultError> { ... }

    /// Retrieve a secret entry by its label (or node ID). Decrypts and returns the secret.
    pub fn get_secret(&self, label: &str) -> Result<SecretEntry, VaultError> { ... }

    /// List all secret labels or traverse a category node to list its children.
    pub fn list_secrets(&self, category: Option<&str>) -> Result<Vec<String>, VaultError> { ... }

    /// Export the entire vault DAG (including all nodes and relationships) to a file.
    /// The exported file remains encrypted (suitable for backup or transfer).
    pub fn export(&self, output_path: &str) -> Result<(), VaultError> { ... }

    /// Import a previously exported DAG, merging it into this vault (or replacing current vault).
    pub fn import(&mut self, input_path: &str) -> Result<(), VaultError> { ... }

    /// (Advanced) Generate a new random password using secure RNG and configurable rules.
    pub fn generate_password(&self, length: usize, charset: Charset) -> String { ... }

    /// (Future/Optional) Share vault or secret: encapsulate vault key for a recipient's public key.
    pub fn export_vault_key_for(&self, recipient_pub: &KyberPublic) -> Result<EncryptedKey, VaultError> { ... }
}
```

*Example usage of the Rust API:*

```rust
use qudag_vault_core::Vault;

// Create a new vault with a master password
let mut vault = Vault::create("vault.qdag", "CorrectHorseBatteryStaple")?;  
vault.add_secret("email/google", "alice@gmail.com", Some("Pa$$w0rd"))?;    // Add a secret
vault.add_secret("server/root", "root", None)?;  // Add a secret, letting library generate a random password
let secret = vault.get_secret("email/google")?;
println!("Retrieved password for {}: {}", secret.username, secret.password);
vault.export("vault_export.dat")?;              // Export encrypted DAG to file

// Later, or on another machine
let mut vault2 = Vault::open("vault.qdag", "CorrectHorseBatteryStaple")?;  
vault2.import("vault_export.dat")?;            // Import secrets from backup
let list = vault2.list_secrets(None)?;         // List all secret labels
```

In this API, errors are handled via a `VaultError` enum (covering cases like incorrect password, I/O errors, cryptographic failures, etc.). The API ensures that plaintext secrets only live in memory transiently: e.g. `get_secret` decrypts data into a `SecretEntry` which implements `Drop` to zeroize the password field. The DAG traversal functions (`list_secrets`, etc.) operate on metadata (labels, node relationships) and do not decrypt passwords unless explicitly requested, which improves performance and security (only decrypt what is needed).

## CLI Command Integration

We will integrate vault functionality into the existing **QuDAG CLI** (`qudag` command) as a new subcommand category. This ensures users have a one-stop tool and that our commands follow the same style and parsing rules as QuDAG’s CLI. Using the Clap library (already likely used in QuDAG CLI), we add a **`vault`** command with subcommands for each vault operation:

* **`qudag vault init [<vault-path>]`** – Initialize a new vault. This will prompt the user for a master password (with confirmation) if not provided via flag. It then calls `Vault::create` to generate the vault file (default path could be `~/.qudag/vault.qdag` if not specified). On success, outputs a message like *“Vault created at <path>”*. (If the file already exists, it will warn or require `--force`.)

* **`qudag vault open <vault-path>`** – (If needed for persistent session) Opens a vault and optionally caches the unlocked vault in memory for subsequent commands. However, since CLI tools are typically stateless, we will likely open the vault on each operation command instead. This subcommand might simply verify that the vault can be opened with the given password. In practice, the user will run `qudag vault add/get` directly with the password prompt, so an explicit open may not be necessary.

* **`qudag vault add <label>`** – Add a new secret. The CLI will prompt for username and password (with an option to generate a random password). For example: `qudag vault add "email/google"` will ask for username (e.g. [alice@gmail.com](mailto:alice@gmail.com)) and either prompt for a password or accept `--generate` flag to create one. This invokes `Vault::add_secret` and on success prints a confirmation (and if a password was generated, perhaps displays it or offers to copy to clipboard, with a warning to save it).

* **`qudag vault get <label>`** – Retrieve a secret’s details. This will open the vault (prompt for the master password if not already provided via an environment variable or config), then call `Vault::get_secret(label)`. The password is sensitive, so the CLI can either display it in the console (with a big warning about visibility) or optionally copy it to clipboard if the environment allows (for security, we might integrate with an OS-specific clipboard utility). By default, it might output the username and password in a formatted way (or JSON if `--format json` is specified, aligning with QuDAG CLI’s support for JSON output).

* **`qudag vault list [<category>]`** – List stored secret labels, either all or under a specified category (if the vault uses categories in labels like "category/name"). This calls `Vault::list_secrets` and prints the results (e.g. as a simple list, or a tree if showing category hierarchy). This helps users discover what entries exist without printing sensitive data.

* **`qudag vault export <file>`** – Export the vault’s DAG to a file. This uses `Vault::export`, writing an encrypted representation of the entire DAG. The CLI will ensure the output file is created with appropriate permissions. After exporting, it prints a success message like “Vault exported to backup.qdag”. (We emphasize that the export is still encrypted with the vault key, so it’s safe to transport, but only accessible with the master password.)

* **`qudag vault import <file>`** – Import a previously exported DAG file. This opens the current vault (prompts for master password), then calls `Vault::import` to merge or load the secrets from the file. The CLI may ask for confirmation if importing into a non-empty vault (to avoid accidental overwrites). On success, it lists how many secrets were imported or merged.

* **(Optional)** `qudag vault genpw [--length N] [--symbols] ...` – A utility command to generate a random password (using the same generator as in the library). This can help users create passwords for other uses. It would output a generated password to stdout. (This is a user-facing “key generation” feature, complementing the library’s `generate_password`.)

The CLI integration will aim for a **consistent user experience**. All commands will support a `-v/--verbose` flag and proper error handling: for example, if a vault is not found or an incorrect password is entered, the CLI prints a clear error. We will reuse QuDAG CLI’s infrastructure for parsing and output formatting. QuDAG’s CLI already has a structured help and JSON output system; our vault commands will plug into that (e.g. by returning data that the CLI can format as table or JSON). This means implementing our subcommands likely in the QuDAG CLI’s `commands.rs` file, under a vault-related module.

*Example CLI usage:*

```
$ qudag vault init 
Enter master password: **** 
Confirm password: **** 
[+] Vault initialized at ~/.qudag/vault.qdag

$ qudag vault add "email/work"
Enter username: bob@company.com
Enter password (leave blank to generate): 
[+] Generated password: X7#V... (copied to clipboard)
[+] Secret "email/work" added to vault.

$ qudag vault list
Secrets in vault:
 - email/google
 - email/work
 - server/root

$ qudag vault get email/google
Username: alice@gmail.com
Password: Pa$$w0rd

$ qudag vault export backup.qdag 
[+] Vault DAG exported to "backup.qdag"
```

(These commands will all invoke the underlying Rust API; the state (vault contents) is not persisted in memory between commands unless we implement a daemon, so each command opens the vault file anew. In the future, we might run a background vault service for performance, but initially the simplicity of stateless CLI is acceptable.)

## Node.js and Python SDK Integration

To support external integration, we will provide lightweight SDKs for **Node.js** and **Python** that wrap the Rust library via FFI:

* **Node.js (N-API Addon):** We will create a Node addon using Node-API (N-API). Using the `napi-rs` crate, we can expose Rust functions/classes to JavaScript in a high-level way. We’ll expose a `Vault` class in Node that mirrors the Rust API. For instance, the Rust methods `Vault::create`, `open`, `add_secret`, etc., will be available as methods on the Node `Vault` object. Under the hood, the Node addon will manage a pointer to a Rust `Vault` instance and ensure proper memory management.

  **Example:** In Rust (within `qudag-vault-node` crate) we might write:

  ```rust
  #[napi]
  pub struct Vault {
      inner: qudag_vault_core::Vault
  }

  #[napi]
  impl Vault {
      #[napi(factory)]
      pub fn create(path: String, master_password: String) -> Result<Vault> {
          let vault = qudag_vault_core::Vault::create(&path, &master_password)
              .map_err(|e| napi::Error::from_reason(e.to_string()))?;
          Ok(Vault { inner: vault })
      }

      #[napi(factory)]
      pub fn open(path: String, master_password: String) -> Result<Vault> { ... }

      #[napi]
      pub fn add_secret(&mut self, label: String, username: String, password: Option<String>) -> Result<()> { ... }

      #[napi]
      pub fn get_secret(&self, label: String) -> Result<SecretEntry> { ... }

      // ... and so on for list_secrets, export, import.
  }
  ```

  This will compile into a `.node` binary that can be required by Node.js. We will also provide TypeScript definitions for the module (napi-rs can generate these, or we manually write a `.d.ts`). The Node API might simplify some aspects: e.g. returning a JS object for `get_secret` with fields `{label, username, password}`.

  To distribute, we can precompile binaries for common platforms or use `neon`/`napi` build tools so that `npm install` compiles it. External developers can then do:

  ```js
  const { Vault } = require('qudag-vault');
  let vault = Vault.create("vault.qdag", "Secret123");
  vault.add_secret("web/facebook", "alice_fb", "fb_password");
  let secret = vault.get_secret("web/facebook");
  console.log(secret.password);
  ```

  This enables Node.js applications or Electron apps to leverage the vault securely. (We’ll ensure that exceptions map to JS errors and that no sensitive data is accidentally copied into long-lived JS strings.)

* **Python (PyO3 Module):** We will expose the library as a Python package named (for example) `qudag_vault`. Using PyO3, we can create Python classes/functions that wrap our Rust API. The `#[pyclass]` and `#[pymethods]` macros will help create a Python `Vault` class.

  For instance:

  ```rust
  #[pyclass]
  struct Vault {
      inner: qudag_vault_core::Vault
  }

  #[pymethods]
  impl Vault {
      #[new]
      fn py_new(path: &str, master_password: &str) -> PyResult<Self> {
          let vault = qudag_vault_core::Vault::open(path, master_password)
              .map_err(|e| PyErr::new::<pyo3::exceptions::PyValueError, _>(format!("{}", e)))?;
          Ok(Vault { inner: vault })
      }

      fn add_secret(&mut self, label: &str, username: &str, password: Option<&str>) -> PyResult<()> { ... }

      fn get_secret(&self, label: &str) -> PyResult<(String, String, String)> { 
          // return (label, username, password) tuple
      }

      // ... list_secrets, export, import similarly ...
  }
  ```

  In this design, creating a `Vault` instance in Python will automatically call `open` (or we can provide separate classmethods for create/open if needed). We will also consider security aspects like not exposing raw bytes of encrypted data in Python unnecessarily.

  We’ll package this with **maturin**, which allows building and publishing Python wheels easily. We can publish to PyPI so users can `pip install qudag_vault`. Maturin can be integrated in CI to build for Windows, Mac, Linux (manylinux) ensuring broad compatibility. The new `uv` tool (a fast Python package manager written in Rust) can also be used to install or publish our package.

  **Example usage in Python:**

  ```python
  import qudag_vault
  vault = qudag_vault.Vault("vault.qdag", master_password="Secret123")  # opens existing vault
  vault.add_secret("email/google", "alice@gmail.com", "Pa$$w0rd")
  user, username, password = vault.get_secret("email/google")
  print(f"Password for {username} is {password}")
  vault.export("backup.qdag")
  ```

Both SDKs are “basic” in that they expose the primary functionality. As the Rust core evolves, these wrappers can be extended. We ensure that these bindings remain thin and mostly just pass through to the Rust core (to maintain a single source of truth for logic and crypto). This also means improvements in the Rust library (performance or security) benefit all language bindings automatically.

Security note: We will document for Node/Python users that the master password might be needed each time (unless they choose to cache it) and that secrets, once retrieved, reside in the respective runtime’s memory. For Python, we may provide a method to wipe a returned secret or design the API to avoid returning the plaintext directly (for example, a method to copy it to clipboard or to a file descriptor), depending on demand. Initially, straightforward returning of the secret is implemented, with the expectation that higher-level applications will handle it carefully.

## Roadmap: Enterprise Features & Optimizations

The initial implementation focuses on core features, but the design is modular to support advanced enterprise requirements. Future phases will introduce:

* **Biometric Unlock & MFA:** We plan to integrate biometric multi-factor authentication for unlocking the vault. For example, on platforms with biometric APIs (Windows Hello, Touch ID, etc.), the vault could store the master key in the OS secure enclave, unlockable only via biometric verification. The library could provide hooks to supply an additional decryption key from a biometric device or YubiKey. This will be built as an optional module (so consumer users can use a simple password, while enterprise deployments can require biometric or hardware 2FA to decrypt the vault).

* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** For enterprise team vaults, we will support multiple users with different roles and permissions on subsets of secrets. This entails each secret or node in the DAG having an access control list or a policy tag. The vault could be extended to manage multiple encryption keys: e.g. per-team or per-entry keys that are themselves encrypted with each authorized user’s public key. A user with read-only role might get a decryption key but not the ability to create new secrets (which could be enforced by not sharing writing capabilities). We will integrate with corporate identity systems by allowing mapping of user identities to Dilithium public keys (each user in an enterprise has a keypair; their Dilithium pubkey can serve as their identity for signing operations). The vault operations can then require a valid signature from a user with the right role for modifications, and all changes can be verified. This approach leverages QuDAG’s PQC identity primitives and ensures only authorized parties can access or modify secrets.

* **Audit Logging:** Logging every vault access and change is crucial in enterprise settings. We will implement a secure audit log where each event (e.g. secret viewed or modified, user added, vault exported) is recorded. To ensure tamper-evidence, the audit log itself can be implemented as an append-only DAG or blockchain: each log entry could be a node in a log DAG, signed by the actor’s Dilithium key and linked to the previous entry. This chain of signatures and hashes makes the log **immutable and verifiable**. The log can be stored encrypted within the vault or separately (viewable by auditors with a special key). In integration with QuDAG, we may even utilize the QuDAG network to timestamp or replicate logs (for example, publishing hash of log entries to the QuDAG network for distributed integrity). Administrators will be able to query the audit trail (e.g. via CLI or an API, with appropriate permissions).

* **Secure Delegation & Sharing:** We will add capabilities to **share secrets or vault access securely** with third parties. Secure delegation means a user can grant someone else one-time or time-limited access to a secret without revealing their master password or giving full vault access. This can be achieved by using hybrid encryption: for instance, generate a one-time AES key for the secret, encrypt the secret with it, then use the delegate’s Kyber public key to encapsulate that AES key. The delegate can decapsulate with their private key and decrypt the secret. This process can be automated by a command like `qudag vault delegate <label> --to <recipient>` which outputs a package that can be sent to the recipient (who can use their key to open it, perhaps via their own vault instance). We will also allow delegates to be pre-defined (e.g. an emergency access user who has a pre-shared piece of the vault key, unlocked via Shamir Secret Sharing or similar scheme – an advanced feature for disaster recovery).

* **Performance & Scalability Optimizations:** As the vault grows (in entries or users), we will optimize performance. Potential improvements include using a database backend (SQLite or RocksDB) instead of a single file for faster queries on large vaults – note QuDAG already includes RocksDB and SQLx in dependencies which we can leverage for persistent storage of DAG nodes. We will also optimize cryptographic operations by using SIMD and parallelism where possible (e.g. bulk decrypting multiple secrets can be done in parallel threads). QuDAG’s metrics show optimized performance for its crypto (e.g. Kyber decapsulation \~1.12 ms) – we will inherit these benefits and continue to profile our library with tools like criterion benchmarks. If needed, we can cache derived keys (for example, cache the Argon2-derived master key in memory while the vault is open, to avoid redoing the KDF on every operation) – protected by memory encryption or enclave on supported hardware.

* **Distributed Vault & Consensus:** In the long term, a truly novel feature would be to allow a vault to be **distributed across multiple nodes using QuDAG’s DAG-based consensus**. In an enterprise cluster or a peer-to-peer use case, multiple QuDAG nodes could hold copies of the encrypted vault and propagate updates via the QuDAG network. QuDAG’s Avalanche-based DAG consensus could ensure all nodes agree on the latest vault state in a quantum-resistant way. Conflict resolution (if two updates happen concurrently) would be handled by the consensus mechanism, providing eventual consistency without a central server. This would effectively create a decentralized password manager network – aligning with QuDAG’s vision of an anonymous, distributed infrastructure. While this is a complex feature, our initial design (using the DAG for internal structure and PQC for sharing) lays the groundwork for such extension.

* **Continuous Security Audits & Hardening:** We will subject the vault system to rigorous security testing. This includes formal audits of the cryptographic implementations, fuzz testing for parsing/serialization (especially on import/export), and utilizing tools like `cargo audit` to monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities. We will keep the library up-to-date with evolving PQC standards; for instance, if NIST releases new versions or recommends algorithm tweaks, the modular design allows swapping out or upgrading algorithms with minimal impact on the overall system.

* **User Experience Improvements:** Although the initial focus is CLI and programmatic use, we anticipate adding a GUI or browser extension for broader adoption. The core library will remain in Rust, but we might create bindings for web (via WebAssembly, given our Rust code can compile to WASM) to use the vault in browser contexts securely. Enterprise features like SSO integration (e.g. unlocking the vault via OAuth2 corporate login) can be layered on by having an external authentication step that then supplies the decryption key to the library.

In summary, this implementation plan provides a secure, QuDAG-aligned foundation for password management. By leveraging QuDAG’s **quantum-resistant crypto and DAG architecture**, we achieve a system that is future-proof against quantum threats and structurally prepared for distributed operation. The initial version delivers all core features (vault creation, secret storage/retrieval, CLI and SDK access, encrypted backup) with a strong emphasis on security (AES-256-GCM encryption via PQC-protected keys, memory safety, clear role separation). The project’s modular nature will allow us to incorporate enterprise requirements like MFA, RBAC, auditing, and secure sharing in iterative phases without major redesign. Each future feature will be implemented in accordance with QuDAG’s principles of security and anonymity, ensuring the vault system remains robust and extensible for years to come.

Here is a step-by-step swarm plan—built on your SPARC-enabled Claude-flow framework—to orchestrate parallel agents for the QuDAG vault library. Each phase spawns specialized sub-agents, runs in parallel where possible, and converges via a coordinator. Replace placeholders (`<…>`) with your repo paths or config as needed.

---

## 1. Initialize the Swarm

```bash
npx claude-flow@latest init \
  --sparc \
  --name qudag-vault-swarm \
  --repo https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-code-flow
```

This sets up a SPARC-style swarm named `qudag-vault-swarm` in your Claude-flow workspace.

---

## 2. Specification Phase

Spawn a **Specification Agent** to define requirements.

```bash
Task(RequirementSpecAgent):
  Role: specification
  Prompt: |
    Draft a detailed spec for a Rust-based QuDAG vault library.
      • Core features: vault create/open, add/get/list secrets
      • Crypto: Argon2id KDF, AES-256-GCM, Kyber KEM wrap, Dilithium signatures
      • Data model: DAG of encrypted nodes with versioning
      • CLI commands: init, add, get, list, export, import
      • SDKs: Node.js (napi-rs), Python (PyO3/maturin)
    Output: JSON schema of APIs, data formats, CLI flags.
```

---

## 3. Pseudocode Phase

Spawn a **Pseudocode Agent** in parallel.

```bash
Task(PseudocodeAgent):
  Role: pseudocode
  Prompt: |
    Based on the spec JSON, write high-level pseudocode for:
      1. Vault struct lifecycle (create/open)
      2. Secret node add/get/list
      3. Export/import logic
      4. Encryption key derivation and wrapping
    Organize pseudocode by module: vault_core, crypto, dag, cli, sdk_node, sdk_python.
    Output: Annotated pseudocode files per module.
```

---

## 4. Architecture Phase

Spawn an **Architecture Agent**.

```bash
Task(ArchitectureAgent):
  Role: architecture
  Prompt: |
    Design the Rust workspace tree and Cargo.toml layout.
    For each crate, list dependencies and feature flags.
    Show the call graph: how vault_core → qudag-crypto → aes-gcm → pqc_kyber connects.
    Include sample `napi-rs` and `PyO3` build settings.
    Output: `tree.txt` of file/folder layout with dependency graph.
```

---

## 5. Implementation Phase (Parallel)

Spawn specialized implementers in parallel:

```bash
Task(CryptoAgent):
  Role: code
  Prompt: |
    Implement `crypto.rs` wrappers:
      – Argon2id KDF
      – AES-256-GCM encrypt/decrypt
      – Kyber keypair / encapsulate / decapsulate
      – Dilithium sign/verify
    Include unit tests for each primitive.

Task(DagAgent):
  Role: code
  Prompt: |
    Build `dag.rs` using `qudag-dag`:
      – Node struct for SecretEntry
      – Traversal helpers
      – Version branching support
    Include tests for acyclicity and traversal.

Task(CoreAgent):
  Role: code
  Prompt: |
    Implement `vault.rs`:
      – Vault::create/open
      – add_secret, get_secret, list_secrets
      – export/import
    Integrate crypto and DAG modules.

Task(CliAgent):
  Role: code
  Prompt: |
    Extend `qudag` CLI:
      – Add `vault` subcommand group with init, add, get, list, export, import
      – Secure password prompts
      – JSON or table output formatting
    Include tests for CLI flag parsing.

Task(NodeSdkAgent):
  Role: code
  Prompt: |
    Create `qudag-vault-node` using napi-rs:
      – Expose Vault class with methods create, open, add, get, list, export, import
      – Generate TypeScript definitions
    Include simple example usage.

Task(PythonSdkAgent):
  Role: code
  Prompt: |
    Create PyO3 module `qudag_vault`:
      – Expose Vault class with __new__, add_secret, get_secret, list_secrets, export, import
      – Configure maturin for wheel builds
    Include Python unit tests.
```

All implementers run concurrently. Each writes code files under `crates/<crate-name>/src`.

## 6. Coordination & Merge

```bash
Task(CoordinatorAgent):
  Role: refinement
  Dependencies:
    - RequirementSpecAgent
    - PseudocodeAgent
    - ArchitectureAgent
    - CryptoAgent
    - DagAgent
    - CoreAgent
    - CliAgent
    - NodeSdkAgent
    - PythonSdkAgent
  Prompt: |
    1. Merge module outputs into workspace tree.
    2. Detect spec-pseudocode mismatches.
    3. Run `cargo test` and fail fast on compile or test errors.
    4. Validate CLI examples and SDK examples compile and pass smoke tests.
    5. Generate a report of inconsistencies or failures.
    6. Propose fixes or clarification questions.
```

---

## 7. Refinement Loops

Spawn a **Reflection Agent** to address Coordinator’s report:

```bash
Task(ReflectionAgent):
  Role: reflection
  Prompt: |
    For each failure or inconsistency in the coordinator report:
      – Identify root cause (spec mismatch, missing import, test error)
      – Propose code changes or spec updates
    Output: Patch suggestions in unified diff format.
```

Apply patches, then re-run CoordinatorAgent until all tests pass.

---

## 8. Completion Phase

```bash
Task(AssemblyAgent):
  Role: completion
  Prompt: |
    1. Generate final README.md with quickstart for Rust, CLI, Node, Python.
    2. Bump versions in Cargo.toml, package.json, pyproject.toml.
    3. Create GitHub Actions CI pipeline:
       – Rust build & test matrix
       – npm publish on tag
       – maturin publish wheels on tag
    4. Tag release v0.1.0 and prepare changelog.
```

---

## 9. Next-Phase Roadmap

After v0.1.0, spawn targeted agents for:

* Biometric MFA integration
* Enterprise RBAC & policy agents
* Audit log DAG agent
* Distributed vault consensus agent

---

This swarm plan leverages your Claude-flow SPARC pattern to parallelize domain-specific work, maintain strict coordination, and deliver a tested, multi-language QuDAG vault library end to end. Let me know if you’d like example prompts or further granularity in any phase.
