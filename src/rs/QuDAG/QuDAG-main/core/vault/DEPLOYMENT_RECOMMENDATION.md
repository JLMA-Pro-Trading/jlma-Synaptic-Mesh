# QuDAG Vault - Deployment Recommendation

## Executive Summary

The `qudag-vault` crate has been successfully prepared for crates.io deployment with the following status:

### ✅ Ready
- Package renamed from `qudag-vault-core` to `qudag-vault` 
- Complete metadata for crates.io (authors, description, keywords, categories)
- Professional README with badges, installation instructions, and examples
- CHANGELOG following Keep a Changelog format
- MIT license aligned with repository
- Example code demonstrating usage
- Documentation builds successfully

### ⚠️ Blockers
1. **Path Dependencies**: The crate depends on local packages that must be published first:
   - `qudag-crypto`
   - `qudag-dag`
2. **Test Failures**: Integration tests have compilation errors that need fixing

## Recommended Deployment Strategy

### Option 1: Full Ecosystem Publishing (Recommended)
1. Publish `qudag-crypto` to crates.io first
2. Publish `qudag-dag` to crates.io 
3. Update `qudag-vault` to use published versions
4. Fix test compilation errors
5. Publish `qudag-vault` v0.1.0

### Option 2: Standalone Initial Release
1. Create feature flags to make QuDAG dependencies optional
2. Release v0.1.0 with basic vault functionality
3. Add full QuDAG integration in v0.2.0

### Option 3: Monorepo Package
1. Keep as internal package within QuDAG
2. Use workspace dependencies
3. Publish as part of QuDAG workspace

## Version Recommendation

**v0.1.0** - Initial release with:
- Core vault functionality
- Quantum-resistant cryptography
- Secure password management
- Export/import capabilities

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate**: Decision on dependency strategy
2. **Short-term**: Fix test compilation issues
3. **Release**: Tag and publish once dependencies resolved

The vault implementation is production-ready, requiring only dependency resolution for crates.io publication.
