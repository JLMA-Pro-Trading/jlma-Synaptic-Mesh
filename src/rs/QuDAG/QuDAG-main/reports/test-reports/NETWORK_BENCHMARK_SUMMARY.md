## Running the Benchmarks

When the build environment is stable, benchmarks can be executed with:

```bash
# Run all network benchmarks
cargo bench -p qudag-network

# Run specific benchmarks
cargo bench -p qudag-network --bench throughput
cargo bench -p qudag-network --bench network_benchmarks
cargo bench -p qudag-network --bench routing_benchmarks

# Run with reduced sample size for quick testing
cargo bench -p qudag-network -- --sample-size 10 --warm-up-time 1 --measurement-time 5
```

## Recommendations

1. **Performance Regression Testing**: Integrate benchmarks into CI/CD pipeline
2. **Baseline Establishment**: Create performance baselines for comparison
3. **Real-World Simulation**: Add network condition simulation (latency, packet loss)
4. **Large-Scale Testing**: Implement distributed benchmark scenarios
