# network-simulate

I need to run a network simulation scenario to test QuDAG's P2P networking, routing, and dark addressing features. 

## Simulation Parameters

**Scenario**: [Specify one of: basic_connectivity, partition, latency, byzantine, sybil_attack, routing_attack, dark_address_discovery, onion_routing, high_load, network_churn]

**Configuration**:
- Node count: [Default: 10, specify if different]
- Duration: [Default: 60 seconds, specify if different]
- Attack parameters (for adversarial scenarios):
  - Attacker ratio: [Fraction of malicious nodes, e.g., 0.3]
  - Attack intensity: [0-1 scale]
  - Target nodes: [Specific nodes to attack]
- Network conditions:
  - Base latency: [milliseconds, e.g., 50ms]
  - Packet loss rate: [0-1 scale, e.g., 0.01]
  - Partition probability: [For partition scenarios]

## Scenario Descriptions

### Basic Connectivity
Test fundamental P2P connectivity and message propagation. Verify that nodes can discover peers, establish connections, and route messages efficiently.

### Dark Address Discovery
Validate the dark addressing system where nodes use cryptographic addresses for anonymity. Test address resolution, anonymity preservation, and lookup performance.

### Onion Routing
Simulate multi-layer encrypted routing where messages traverse through multiple relay nodes. Measure routing overhead, anonymity set size, and circuit construction time.

### Sybil Attack
Test network resilience against Sybil attacks where adversaries create multiple fake identities. Monitor consensus integrity and network fragmentation.

### Routing Attack
Simulate routing manipulation attacks where malicious nodes attempt to intercept or redirect messages. Evaluate routing accuracy and path diversity.

## Performance Targets

The simulation should validate:
- Throughput: 10,000+ messages/second across the network
- Latency (p99): < 1000ms for message delivery
- Memory usage: < 100MB per node
- Scalability: Linear performance with node count

## Expected Metrics

Monitor and report:
1. **Network Topology**: P2P connections, dark addresses, routing diversity
2. **Performance**: Throughput, latency percentiles, delivery rate
3. **Security**: Anonymity set size, attack detection, resilience score
4. **Resources**: Memory, CPU, bandwidth usage per node

## Analysis Focus

Based on the scenario, I should analyze:
- Connection stability and peer discovery efficiency
- Message propagation patterns and delivery guarantees
- Anonymity preservation in dark addressing and onion routing
- Network behavior under adversarial conditions
- Resource consumption and scalability limits

Please execute the network simulation in the QuDAG simulator and provide comprehensive results including topology analysis, performance metrics, security evaluation, and optimization recommendations.
