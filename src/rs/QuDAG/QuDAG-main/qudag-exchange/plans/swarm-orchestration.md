# QuDAG Exchange Swarm Orchestration

## Overview

The QuDAG Exchange is developed and maintained through a **10-agent autonomous swarm**, each agent performing specialized roles in parallel. This swarm uses test-driven development (TDD), modular task routing, and consensus coordination to iteratively build, test, fix, and optimize every part of the system â€” from the ledger to the CLI to the zero-knowledge infrastructure. Swarm orchestration is designed for continuous, decentralized improvement with minimal human intervention.

## Agent Roles

1. **Coordinator Agent**

   * Oversees agent task flow and project state.
   * Manages task queue and merges results.

2. **Test Agent**

   * Writes unit, integration, and property tests.
   * Enforces TDD by defining correctness before implementation.

3. **Core Implementation Agent**

   * Develops rUv ledger, resource metering, and consensus adapters.
   * Works from test specs.

4. **Interface Agent**

   * Builds CLI, API, and WASM interface bindings.
   * Connects core logic to users.

5. **Optimization Agent**

   * Profiles performance and applies parallelism, caching, and metering improvements.

6. **Security Agent**

   * Enforces zero unsafe code.
   * Runs audits, static analysis, and hardens cryptographic flows.

7. **Documentation Agent**

   * Maintains all code comments, user guides, and architecture docs.
   * Auto-generates schema and CLI references.

8. **Verification Agent**

   * Validates functional correctness via fuzzing, model checking, and zk-proof property assertions.

9. **Integration Agent**

   * Ensures module compatibility and resolves cross-agent merge conflicts.

10. **DevOps Agent**

    * Manages CI/CD, container builds, testnet orchestration, and versioning.

## Task Lifecycle

* Coordinator breaks specs into tasks.
* Agents poll task queue and claim work via lockless atomic registry.
* Completed tasks are reviewed and merged by the Integration Agent.
* Swarm iterates until all tests pass, then DevOps Agent triggers CI/CD pipelines.

## Communication & Synchronization

* Agents work via a shared repo and task.json manifest.
* Tasks carry metadata: role, dependencies, status, and review requirements.
* Testing forms the primary source of convergence: agents adjust work until tests pass.

## Isolation & Safety

* Agents run in isolated threads or WASM sandboxes.
* Secrets are managed via `qudag-vault-core` with enforced key isolation.
* No agent has unrestricted control; all commits pass through verification and coordination gates.

## Continuous Improvement

* Swarm continues running post-release.
* It automatically handles regressions, dependency updates, and performance tuning.
* New features are triaged by the Coordinator and spun off into parallel workstreams.

## Result

Swarm orchestration ensures that the QuDAG Exchange is built with resilience, correctness, and parallel velocity. It enables scalable development of decentralized, agentic systems with no single point of failure in its creation lifecycle.
