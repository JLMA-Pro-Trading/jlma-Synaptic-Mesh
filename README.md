# Synaptic-Neural-Mesh

We’re entering an era where intelligence no longer needs to be centralized or monolithic. With today’s tools, we can build globally distributed neural systems where every node, whether a simulated particle, a physical device, or a person, is its own adaptive micro-network.

This is the foundation of the Synaptic Neural Mesh: a self-evolving, peer to peer neural fabric where every element is an agent, learning and communicating across a globally coordinated DAG substrate.

At its core is a fusion of specialized components: QuDAG for secure, post quantum messaging and DAG based consensus, DAA for resilient emergent swarm behavior, ruv-fann, a lightweight neural runtime compiled to Wasm, and ruv-swarm, the orchestration layer managing the life cycle, topology, and mutation of agents at scale.

Each node runs as a Wasm compatible binary, bootstrapped via npx synaptic-mesh init. It launches an intelligent mesh aware agent, backed by SQLite, capable of joining an encrypted DAG network and executing tasks within a dynamic agent swarm. Every agent is a micro neural network, trained on the fly, mutated through DAA cycles, and discarded when obsolete. Knowledge propagates not through RPC calls, but as signed, verifiable DAG entries where state, identity, and logic move independently.

The mesh evolves. It heals. It learns. DAG consensus ensures history. Swarm logic ensures diversity. Neural agents ensure adaptability. Together, they form a living system that scales horizontally, composes recursively, and grows autonomously.

This isn’t traditional AI. It’s distributed cognition. While others scale up monoliths, we’re scaling out minds. Modular, portable, evolvable, this is AGI architecture built from the edge in.

Run npx synaptic-mesh init. You’re not just starting an app. You’re growing a thought.
