**Release Manager**: Market PM Agent
**Date**: 2025-07-13
**Version**: 0.1.0

## Compliance Statement

This release implements a **peer compute federation** model that fully complies with Anthropic's Terms of Service:

1. **No shared API keys** - Each node uses own Claude credentials
2. **Peer-orchestrated model** - No central brokerage or proxying
3. **Incentive tokens** - Rewards contribution, not usage resale
4. **Full user control** - Transparent, voluntary participation
5. **Legal compliance** - Clear terms and usage policies

The Synaptic Market enables voluntary compute sharing while maintaining individual account ownership and control.
