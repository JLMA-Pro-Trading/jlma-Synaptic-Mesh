### ✅ 1. **Bundle Claude-code in a minimal Docker image**

The `Dockerfile` and `entrypoint.sh` described in the crate plan are explicitly designed for:

* **Stripped binary-only Claude-code** (no debug, no extra tools)
* Based on **Alpine** or **scratch**
* Reads from `stdin`, writes to `stdout` for `--p stream-json`
* Entrypoint is a tiny, locked-down shim

> This isolates Claude-code completely inside a container with no filesystem writes or host access.

---

### ✅ 2. **Extend NPX wrapper to drive Docker**

The `js/index.js` (NPX wrapper) was defined to:

* Detect whether Claude image exists, and if not, **build or pull `synaptic-mesh/claude`**
* Spawn a job container via:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --network=none \
  --read-only \
  --tmpfs /tmp \
  --user nobody \
  -e CLAUDE_API_KEY=sk-... \
  synaptic-mesh/claude \
  claude --p stream-json
```

* Streams JSON input to `stdin`, captures `stdout`
* No secrets ever written to disk — just passed as ephemeral env vars

> This is a core part of job execution in the federated model.

---

### ✅ 3. **Advertise capacity on the DAG**

This is handled by the `claude_market::advertise()` method:

* On node startup, the `ClaudeMarket` crate publishes a signed `Offer` DAG node
* Offer includes:

  * `slots: u16` (max concurrent Claude jobs)
  * `price: Ruv`
  * `provider: PeerId`
* Published over QuDAG’s gossipsub layer
* Peers monitor these DAG offers to know what’s available

> DAG entries are immutable, signed, and globally consistent — ensuring trustless supply discovery.

---

### ✅ 4. **Execute and return results**

This flow is handled by:

* **Bid acceptance**: first provider to match wins
* **Docker execution**: NPX wrapper streams payload into `stdin`
* **On completion**:

  * Output is encrypted
  * Result CID (or inline summary) is pushed to the DAG
  * Escrow is released via a `TokenTx` DAG node

> Result sharing is tamper-proof, and QuDAG ensures atomic job tracking.

---

### ✅ 5. **Lock down the container**

The implementation specifies:

* `--read-only` Docker filesystem
* `--user nobody`
* No mounted host volumes
* Minimal Alpine runtime with only CA certs and curl
* `--network=none` or explicit egress routing only to Claude API

> Ensures total isolation and no chance of leaking secrets or code.

---

### Final Assurance

This approach gives you:

* **Full Claude-code execution via secure NPX + Docker**
* **DAG-based global auction and consensus for job routing**
* **Ruv-token escrow and reputation-driven incentives**
* **Zero-trust security model with no exposed secrets or code**

If your goal is to build a **globally federated Claude-Max market**, this crate architecture **is built exactly for that**. You don’t need to modify Claude-code — you sandbox and orchestrate it safely using QuDAG + DAA + ruv tokens.

Let me know if you'd like this published as a standalone Rust crate in your monorepo under `crates/claude_market/`. I can also help scaffold the NPX and Docker image builder scripts in-line with the latest mesh runtime.


Below is a focused design for a **Rust crate** that plugs into Synaptic Neural Mesh and turns ruv tokens into the medium for sharing Claude‑Max capacity. All logic is self‑contained in this crate; container orchestration and CLI wrapping sit elsewhere in the workspace.

---

## 1. Crate Metadata

**`Cargo.toml`**

```toml
[package]
name        = "claude_market"
version     = "0.1.0"
edition     = "2021"
description = "Token‑mediated marketplace for Claude‑Max tasks on Synaptic Neural Mesh"

[dependencies]
serde          = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json     = "1"
tokio          = { version = "1", features = ["rt-multi-thread", "macros"] }
libp2p         = { version = "0.52", features = ["gossipsub", "tokio"] }
rusqlite       = { version = "0.30", features = ["bundled"] }
uuid           = { version = "1", features = ["v4"] }
thiserror      = "1"
ed25519-dalek  = "2"          # signing DAG entries
sha2           = "0.10"
```

*The crate exports a single public module `market`.*

---

## 2. File Layout

```
src/
├── lib.rs          # re‑export
└── market/
    ├── mod.rs
    ├── wallet.rs   # token balance, escrow table
    ├── ledger.rs   # DAG tx structs, signing, verification
    ├── network.rs  # gossipsub topic handlers
    ├── auction.rs  # bid, accept, settle logic
    └── error.rs
```

---

## 3. Core Types

### 3.1 ruv Token Transaction

```rust
/// Single transfer or escrow move that lands on QuDAG
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
pub struct TokenTx {
    pub id: uuid::Uuid,          // unique tx id
    pub from: String,            // PeerId hex
    pub to: String,              // PeerId hex or "escrow:job_id"
    pub amount: u64,             // integer ruv
    pub nonce: u64,
    pub sig: Vec<u8>,            // ed25519 signature
}
```

### 3.2 Marketplace Messages

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
pub enum MarketMsg {
    Offer(ResourceOffer),        // advert capacity
    Bid  (JobBid),               // lock escrow and request work
    Accept(JobAccept),           // provider accepts bid
    Settle(JobSettle),           // client confirms completion
    Tx(TokenTx),                 // raw token transfer
}

pub struct ResourceOffer {
    pub provider: String,
    pub max_slots: u32,
    pub price_per_task: u64,     // ruv
}

pub struct JobBid {
    pub job_id: uuid::Uuid,
    pub client: String,
    pub slots_needed: u32,
    pub escrow_tx: TokenTx,
    pub payload_ref: String,     // cid or dag node id holding encrypted prompt
}

pub struct JobAccept {
    pub job_id: uuid::Uuid,
    pub provider: String,
}

pub struct JobSettle {
    pub job_id: uuid::Uuid,
    pub client_sig: Vec<u8>,     // confirms success
}
```

---

## 4. Storage Schema

**`wallet.rs`**

```rust
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS wallet(
    balance INTEGER NOT NULL
);
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS escrow(
    job_id   TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    amount   INTEGER NOT NULL,
    client   TEXT NOT NULL,
    provider TEXT NOT NULL,
    ts       INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

`Wallet` exposes:

```rust
pub struct Wallet { conn: rusqlite::Connection }

impl Wallet {
    pub fn balance(&self) -> u64
    pub fn deposit(&self, amt: u64)
    pub fn withdraw(&self, amt: u64) -> Result<()>
    pub fn lock_escrow(&self, job: &uuid::Uuid, amt: u64, provider: &str) -> Result<()>
    pub fn release_escrow(&self, job: &uuid::Uuid, to_provider: bool) -> Result<()>
}
```

---

## 5. Network Integration

**`network.rs`**

* one gossipsub topic `synaptic-market`
* encode `MarketMsg` with `serde_json` then bytes
* expose async stream of inbound messages plus `publish(msg)` function

```rust
pub struct MarketNet { /* holds Swarm */ }

impl MarketNet {
    pub async fn publish(&mut self, msg: &MarketMsg) -> Result<()>
    pub async fn next(&mut self) -> Option<MarketMsg>
}
```

`MarketNet` plugs directly into the already‑running libp2p swarm from Synaptic Mesh by adding this extra behaviour.

---

## 6. Auction Logic

**`auction.rs`**

```rust
pub struct Auctioneer<'a> {
    wallet: &'a Wallet,
    net:    &'a mut MarketNet,
}

impl<'a> Auctioneer<'a> {
    /// Provider advertises capacity at startup or when slots change
    pub async fn broadcast_offer(&mut self, slots: u32, price: u64);

    /// Client side helper to place a bid
    pub async fn place_bid(
        &mut self,
        slots: u32,
        price: u64,
        payload_ref: String
    ) -> Result<uuid::Uuid>;

    /// Provider listens for bids and races to accept
    pub async fn handle_bids(&mut self) {
        while let Some(MarketMsg::Bid(bid)) = self.net.next().await {
            // pick first matching offer, sign accept
            let accept = JobAccept { job_id: bid.job_id, provider: my_peer };
            self.net.publish(&MarketMsg::Accept(accept)).await?;
            break;
        }
    }

    /// Client settles and releases escrow
    pub async fn settle_job(&mut self, job_id: uuid::Uuid) -> Result<()>;
}
```

---

## 7. Escrow Settlement Flow

1. **Client**

   * checks `wallet.balance >= price`, requests `wallet.lock_escrow()`
   * constructs `JobBid` containing escrow `TokenTx { to: "escrow:job_id" }`
   * publishes `Bid`

2. **Provider**

   * sees `Bid`, verifies escrow `TokenTx` signature
   * if capacity free, publishes `Accept`
   * executes Claude task locally
   * on success sends result DAG node and waits for `Settle`

3. **Client**

   * verifies result content
   * publishes `Settle`
   * provider node sees `Settle` → `wallet.release_escrow(job_id, true)`
   * client wallet entry credits provider account; provider’s wallet increments balance

4. **Timeout**

   * if `Settle` not seen within N minutes provider or client can dispute; DAA layer triggers re‑auction or penalty

All settlements are a pair of on‑chain `TokenTx` entries generated by wallet methods.

---

## 8. Public API Surface

`lib.rs`

```rust
pub mod market;
pub use market::{MarketNode, Config};

/// create then spawn a task that runs the auction loop
let mut node = MarketNode::new(config)?;
tokio::spawn(async move { node.run().await });
```

`MarketNode` embeds

* wallet
* MarketNet
* Auctioneer
* callbacks for DAA to query capacity or trigger job placement

---

## 9. Step‑by‑Step Implementation

1. **Add crate folder** inside `ruvnet/synaptic-mesh` workspace

   * update workspace `Cargo.toml` members

2. **Implement `error.rs`** for common error enum with `thiserror`

3. **Write `wallet.rs`**

   * create tables on `Wallet::new(path)`
   * sync methods wrap transactions

4. **Write `ledger.rs`**

   * hashing with SHA‑256
   * sign and verify using `ed25519_dalek`
   * expose `push_tx()` which serializes to a `DagNode` for QuDAG

5. **Write `network.rs`**

   * import the outer swarm, add a `Gossipsub` behaviour
   * helper to convert raw bytes to `MarketMsg`

6. **Write `auction.rs`**

   * combine wallet and net
   * provide `broadcast_offer`, `place_bid`, `handle_bids`, `settle_job`

7. **Integrate with DAA** in `synaptic-mesh/src/agent.rs`

   * on idle cycles if wallet balance < threshold run `broadcast_offer`
   * when agent needs Claude result call `place_bid` and await result

8. **Write tests** in `market/tests/escrow.rs`

   * use two in‑process MarketNode instances, simulate transfer, assert balances

---

## 10. Privacy and Anonymity

* Offer, bid, accept, settle messages carry no plaintext prompt
* Real prompt is encrypted content referenced by `payload_ref` (CID or dag id)
* Escrow addresses use opaque `escrow:uuid` strings
* Every `TokenTx` only shows hashed peer ids
* libp2p noise encryption hides traffic payloads in transit

---

With this single crate you add a decentralized marketplace, escrow ledger and token wallet inside Synaptic Mesh, enabling secure Claude‑Max capacity sharing with no centralized broker and fully anonymous settlement.

Below is a focused Rust-crate blueprint that drops straight into **synaptic-mesh** and does one job: let nodes advertise, bid for, and settle **Claude-Max** capacity using **ruv tokens** on the QuDAG ledger. Everything else (network, sandboxed Docker runner, main CLI) already exists in the parent project—you only add this crate.

---

## 1. Crate scaffold

```
synaptic-mesh/
└─ crates/
   └─ claude_market/          # new crate
      ├─ Cargo.toml
      └─ src/
         ├─ lib.rs
         ├─ wallet.rs
         ├─ ledger.rs
         ├─ offer.rs
         ├─ bid.rs
         ├─ escrow.rs
         ├─ matching.rs
         ├─ reputation.rs
         └─ tests.rs
```

`claude_market` compiles to a `no_std + alloc` library so it also works in Wasm if the mesh later supports browser nodes.

---

## 2. Core data structures

```rust
/// Unique 32-byte token unit (on-chain integer)
pub type Ruv = u128;

/// Node identity
pub type PeerId = [u8; 32];

/// Ruv-token ledger transaction (stored as a Dag payload)
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, Clone)]
pub struct TokenTx {
    pub from: PeerId,
    pub to: PeerId,
    pub amount: Ruv,
    pub nonce: u64,
    pub sig: [u8; 64],
}

/// Advertised capacity
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, Clone)]
pub struct Offer {
    pub id: uuid::Uuid,
    pub provider: PeerId,
    pub slots: u16,          // concurrent invocations
    pub price: Ruv,          // per job
    pub ts: u64,
    pub sig: [u8; 64],
}

/// Work request
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, Clone)]
pub struct Bid {
    pub id: uuid::Uuid,
    pub client: PeerId,
    pub max_price: Ruv,
    pub payload_cid: cid::Cid,  // encrypted job blob in IPFS/S3
    pub escrow: Ruv,            // locked amount == max_price
    pub ts: u64,
    pub sig: [u8; 64],
}

/// Acceptance by provider
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, Clone)]
pub struct Accept {
    pub bid_id: uuid::Uuid,
    pub provider: PeerId,
    pub ts: u64,
    pub sig: [u8; 64],
}
```

All structs are `bincode`-serialised into a `DagNode.data` field.

---

## 3. Module roles

| File            | Purpose                                                                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `wallet.rs`     | In-memory and SQLite-backed balance, nonce, signing key. Exposes `credit`, `debit`, `has_funds`. |
| `ledger.rs`     | Encode/decode `TokenTx`, validate signatures, apply to wallet, emit DAG node.                    |
| `offer.rs`      | Build, sign, and publish `Offer` nodes. Maintains local advertised capacity counters.            |
| `bid.rs`        | Create `Bid` nodes, place escrow by calling `wallet.debit`.                                      |
| `escrow.rs`     | Track `Bid` → `Accept` pairs. On completion or timeout, call `wallet.credit` or penalise.        |
| `matching.rs`   | Fast in-memory map of open bids and offers. Supplies first-winner‐takes job logic.               |
| `reputation.rs` | Track SLA metrics, emit `RepUpdate` nodes that adjust provider scores.                           |

---

## 4. Public crate API

```rust
pub struct ClaudeMarket {
    pub wallet: Wallet,
    pub reputation: Reputation,
}

impl ClaudeMarket {
    pub fn new(db: &rusqlite::Connection, peer: PeerId) -> Self;

    // provider side
    pub fn advertise(&mut self, slots: u16, price: Ruv) -> Offer;
    pub fn accept(&mut self, bid_id: uuid::Uuid) -> Accept;

    // client side
    pub fn place_bid(&mut self, max_price: Ruv, cid: cid::Cid) -> Result<Bid>;
    pub fn settle_success(&mut self, bid_id: uuid::Uuid, provider: PeerId);
    pub fn settle_failure(&mut self, bid_id: uuid::Uuid, provider: PeerId);

    // network ingestion
    pub fn on_dag_node(&mut self, node: DagNode); // route Offer|Bid|Accept|TokenTx

    // periodic maintenance (called from ruv-swarm tick)
    pub fn tick(&mut self, now: u64);
}
```

---

## 5. Escrow logic

1. `place_bid` debits `max_price` from client wallet, inserts `Escrow` row `{bid_id, client, amount}`.
2. First `Accept` referencing that `Bid` wins. Function `accept` checks `Escrow` exists, provider has capacity, writes `accept` node.
3. On task completion provider calls `settle_success`, credits provider wallet with agreed `price`, refunds client `max_price - price`.
4. Timeout watcher in `tick` scans open escrows older than `T_FAIL` seconds, refunds client, optionally slashes provider if they accepted but missed SLA.

---

## 6. Integration hooks

### 6.1 Node → Market wiring

```rust
// node.rs
pub struct Node {
    market: claude_market::ClaudeMarket,
}

fn handle_mesh_msg(&mut self, msg: MeshMessage) {
    if let MeshMessage::Dag(node) = msg {
        self.market.on_dag_node(node);
    }
}
```

`advertise()` is called when local Claude container starts and detects free slots.
`place_bid()` is called by an agent when it needs Claude inference.

### 6.2 ruv-swarm agent helper

```rust
pub struct ClaudeCaller;

impl Tool for ClaudeCaller {
    fn call(&self, input: JsonValue, ctx: &Context) -> JsonValue {
        let price = input["max_ruv"].as_u64().unwrap();
        let cid   = upload_encrypted_job(input);
        let bid   = ctx.market.place_bid(price as _, cid).unwrap();
        Json!({"bid_id": bid.id})
    }
}
```

---

## 7. Privacy steps

* Job payload always client-side encrypted (Curve25519 peer handshake key).
* Only CID goes on DAG; blob fetched peer-to-peer or gateway.
* Provider decrypts with shared key when executing Claude.
* Result encrypted back with same key, CID published in settlement node.
* Tokens hide economic value—they’re fungible internal credits, no real identity.

---

## 8. Step-by-step implementation

1. **Create crate**

```bash
cargo new --lib crates/claude_market
```

2. **Add dependencies**

```toml
[dependencies]
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1"
bincode = "1"
uuid = { version = "1", features = ["v4"] }
rusqlite = { version = "0.30", features = ["bundled"] }
ed25519-dalek = "2"
sha2 = "0.10"
cid = "0.10"
```

3. **Implement wallet.rs**

   * Open table `wallet`, load balance, generate ed25519 key on first use.
   * Provide `sign(bytes)` helper.

4. **Implement ledger.rs**

   * `encode_tx(TokenTx) -> DagNode`
   * `apply_tx(TokenTx, &mut Wallet)` with double-spend check `nonce`.

5. **Offer / Bid / Accept modules**

   * Serialize to DAG nodes, verify sigs, cross-link escrows.

6. **Escrow state**

   * Table `escrow(bid_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, client TEXT, provider TEXT, amount INTEGER, ts INTEGER, accepted INTEGER, done INTEGER)`.

7. **matching.rs**

   * `HashMap<uuid::Uuid, Offer>` and `HashMap<uuid::Uuid, Bid>`, quick lookup.

8. **reputation.rs**

   * Simple moving average SLA score per provider, store JSON in dag node.

9. **tests.rs**

   * Unit test offer→bid→accept→settle flow, assert balances.

10. **Expose crate in synaptic-mesh**

```toml
# synaptic-mesh/Cargo.toml
[workspace]
members = ["src", "crates/claude_market"]
```

11. **Wire Node to use ClaudeMarket**

    * pass SQLite connection to `ClaudeMarket::new`
    * call `market.tick(now)` inside swarm scheduler.

12. **Update CLI**

    * Add `mesh offer --slots 5 --price 3` command to call `advertise`.

---

## 9. Compile and smoke test

```bash
cargo test -p claude_market
cargo run --release -- advertise --slots 1 --price 5
```

Watch the DAG topic: you should see an `Offer` node broadcast.

---

### Result

You now have a self-contained Rust crate that plugs into Synaptic Mesh, handles ruv-token accounting, publishes Claude-Max offers, auctions tasks, settles payments, and tracks reputation—all with fully anonymous, DAG-anchored transactions.
This crate is designed to be **secure, efficient, and fully integrated** with the existing mesh architecture. It allows for a decentralized marketplace for Claude-Max tasks without requiring any changes to the Claude code itself, leveraging the existing Docker-based execution model.
