## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Crate Configuration Fixed
- **Issue**: Tests couldn't access library due to `crate-type = ["cdylib"]` only
- **Solution**: Added `"rlib"` to enable Rust library access: `crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]`
- **Result**: Full test access to all public APIs

### Test Architecture
- **Real Implementation Testing**: Replaced all mock tests with actual functionality validation
- **Concurrency Testing**: Multi-threaded safety validation using `Arc<T>` and `std::thread`
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive edge case testing including security scenarios
- **Memory Testing**: Large-scale object creation and resource management validation
- **Performance Awareness**: Tests include timing considerations and efficiency validation

### Test Dependencies Added
