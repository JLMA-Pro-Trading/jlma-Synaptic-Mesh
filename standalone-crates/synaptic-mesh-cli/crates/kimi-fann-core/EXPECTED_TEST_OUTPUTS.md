    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:

## Routing Logic Outputs

### Correct Expert Selection
The router should correctly identify the primary domain for queries:

**Test Cases:**
1. `"def quicksort(arr): # implement this"` â†’ Routes to **Coding** expert
2. `"âˆ« xÂ² dx from 0 to 1"` â†’ Routes to **Mathematics** expert
3. `"traduis cette phrase en anglais"` â†’ Routes to **Language** expert
4. `"analyze the logical structure"` â†’ Routes to **Reasoning** expert

**Expected Output Pattern:**
```
Routed to [Domain] expert
[Expert-specific response with neural indicators]
```

## Consensus Mode Outputs

### Complex Multi-Domain Queries
**Input:** `"Design and implement a machine learning algorithm for predicting stock prices"`
**Expected Output:**
```
Runtime: Query received
Mode: Consensus
6 experts active
Multi-expert consensus processing...

Consensus Results:
- Reasoning Expert: Analyzed problem requirements (conf=0.86)
- Mathematics Expert: Provided statistical models (conf=0.92)
- Coding Expert: Suggested implementation approach (conf=0.89)
- Context Expert: Referenced similar problems (conf=0.81)

## Performance Metrics

### Expected Performance Ranges

| Query Complexity | Expected Response Time | Neural Confidence |
|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Simple          | < 100ms               | 0.85-0.95        |
| Medium          | 100-300ms             | 0.80-0.90        |
| Complex         | 300-500ms             | 0.75-0.85        |
| Very Complex    | 500-1000ms            | 0.70-0.80        |

### Concurrent Processing
When processing 5 concurrent requests, expect:
- All requests complete successfully
- Each maintains independent neural processing
- No cross-contamination between responses
- Runtime metadata present in all outputs

## Error Handling

### Edge Cases
The system should handle these gracefully:

1. **Empty Input:** Returns minimal runtime metadata
2. **Special Characters:** Processes safely without injection
3. **Very Long Input:** Truncates or summarizes appropriately
4. **Unicode/Emoji:** Handles international characters correctly

### Example Error Response
```
Runtime: Query received
Mode: Standard
6 experts active
Warning: Input validation detected potential issues
Processing with safety constraints...
[Safe, sanitized response]
```

## Verification Checklist

When running tests, verify:

- [ ] All expert domains respond with neural indicators
- [ ] Routing correctly identifies primary domains
- [ ] Consensus mode activates for complex queries
- [ ] Performance stays within expected ranges
- [ ] Edge cases handled without crashes
- [ ] Concurrent processing maintains isolation
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable
- [ ] WASM builds successfully

## Notes

1. Neural confidence values may vary slightly between runs due to the probabilistic nature of neural processing
2. Exact output text may differ while maintaining the same semantic content
3. Performance times depend on hardware but should remain within the specified ranges
4. The presence of "Neural:", "conf=", "patterns=", or "var=" indicates active neural processing
